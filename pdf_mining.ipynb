excellency the secretary general of the united nations  ladies gentlemen it is with great honor that i address the 2 6th conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change the republic of angola considers climate change one of the greatest challenges facing humanity due t o the set of direct and indirect effects that they cause to the economic and social life of nations a fact that constitutes a real challenge to development we embrace the cause of mang rove restoration and protection through a national campaign to replant mangrove seedlings along the extensive national coastline we favor the production and consumption of clean energy from existing hydroelectric dams and others to be built as well as from renewable energy sources with emphasis on photovoltaic energy prod uction projects with solar parks that will reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in the production of electricity currently the national energy matrix already incorporates 62 of non  polluting energy sources aiming to reach 70 by 2025 we have just s i gned in washington dc with iccf and conservation international an agreement for the conservation of the luengue  luiana and mavinga parks for the protection of animal and plant wildlife and the development of sustainable international touri sm we approved the national strategy for climate change 2021  2035 aiming to achieve the goals set out in the paris agreement as well as an important environmental legislative package containing the instruments that will enable a decisive contribution to the global ef fort to mitigate the causes and adapt angola to the effects of climate change angola is aligned with the international consensus on sustainable development including africa 2063 in line with the sustainable development goals excellencies angola defined its nationally determined contribution to reduce carbon intensity in the production of electricity in a horizon until 2025 and complementary actions in the field of sustainable management of fore sts transport and agriculture adaptation ac tions to improve climate resilience of our communities and protecting social and economic investments were also included  we reiterate the firm commitment and determinati on of angola to remain engaged in climate action and to the adoption of a low  carbon development model thank you ', ' alliance of small island states cop26 world leaders summit 2021 statement to by the honourable gaston browne prime minister of antigua and barbuda and chair of the alliance of small island states november 1 2021 excellencies ladies and gentlemen i make this statement on behalf of the alliance of small island states and i begin by thanking the government of the united kingdom for hosting this important  from which much is expected small island developing states attend this meeting troubled that the world is teetering dangerously on the precipice of a climate catastrophe if we overshoot the 15 degrees goal with fatal consequences for all especially sids those effects have been evident in more frequ ent catastrophic climate events that have decimated lives and livelihoods the difference between small island developing states and industrialized nations is the capacity to respond it takes a single storm a few hours to destroy the economy and infr astructure of an entire small island state which lacks the necessary financial and other resources to rebound and rebuild colleagues this is now the perennial experience that small island developing states suffer through no fault of their own this s ituation has weakened our ability to plan our economic and social development with predictability c olleagues i remind that the contribution of all small island developing states to carbon dioxide emissions and c limate c hange is less than one per cent o f the global emissions highest price surely the time has c ome for such excesses and injustice to end colleagues the scale of funding for climate adaptation and mitigation has been sadly inadequate it needs to be increased significantly if justice is to be served antigua and barbu d a aosis chairmanship 2021  2022 2 aosis calls for direct attention to loss and damage at this cop as a distinct issue in its own right  not just on the margins of adaptation  such loss and damage have persisted for decades but compensation has been neglected by the governments of the worst polluting countries for far too long should no formal mechanism for loss and damage compensation be established member countries of the united nations may be prepared to seek justice in the appropriate international bodies we hoped that no one would have had to come to such a position but our very existence now depends on urgent attention to our perilous situation colleagues we are all aware that the promise made 12 years ago by the developed countries  to provide 100 billion annually in climate finance  to help deal with the effects of c limate c hange has not been fulfilled however the g20 countries have  since the adoption of the paris agreement provided over 3 trillion us dollars in support to the fossil fuel industry including excessive subsidi es with we are also aware that the oecd has confirmed that climate finance to sids dropped by more than 600 million between 2018 and 2019  colleagues we can all ag ree that this is regressive  worse yet such financing as available is subject to conditionalities including the inconsiderate and wrongful criterion of per capita income ssibility should be based on their vulnerability colleagues all of this makes cop26 a truly decisive moment for small islands and countries with low  lying coast al states  this is the last decade the world has to avoid the worst impacts of global wa rming and cop 26 is our last chance to deliver on ambitious commitments and actions to avert catastrophic consequences i plead that we do not squander this crucial opportunity  cop26 should deliver the following commitments reduced emissions to keep temperatures below 15 degrees phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies scaled up and accessible adaptation and mitigation funding and a firm mechanism for loss and damage as we work in global solidarity to save our planet and human civilization there i s work to be done we are on the clock our children are watching ', '1 address by he president armen sarkissian at the un climate change conference cop26 glasgow 1  2 november 2021 excellencies ladies and gentlemen this significant and timely event special thanks to prime minister boris johnson his colleagues and the city of glasgow for an excellent summit and warm hospitality first about armenia  a small state but a global nation according to the world bank analy sis armenia is the 4th most vulnerable country to climate change in the eastern europe and central asia region armenia has registered a 13 degrees celsius increase in temperature and a 9 percent decrease in precipitation despite the challenges by the covid  19 pandemic and ongoing nagorno  karabakh conflict we are committed to a stronger integration into the global agenda on climate change and to demonstrating an increase in our climate ambition armenia has consistently expressed its commitment to joi ning global efforts to combat climate change in 2021 armenia reaffirmed our commitment through the nationally determined contributions and declared an objective of 40 percent reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to the 1990 levels the long  term objective of armenia is to achieve climate neutrality in the second half of this century energy security and green growth policies 2 our vision of resil ient and low  carbon growth is directly connected to a solid and effective adaptation strategy based on an ecosystem approach reforestation investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency new high technologies promotion of electric mobility and f urther development of nuclear energy dear colleagues substantial public debt burdens most developing economies in their ability to access concessional and non  concessional climate finance in this regard a creative approach is crucial i am delighted to share with you our  for  instrument and it will help developing countries to adapt more efficiently to climate change finance and provide new economic opportunities mr president exactly one year ago during the war against nagorno  karabakh azerbaijan used internationally banned weapons to target not only civilians but also beautiful forests of the large area causing massive forest fires and creating environmental di sasters in place we call on the international community to step up its efforts to prevent such irresponsible and inhumane behaviour the environmental challenges do not recognize borders and conflict lines and we should bring all states of the world int o comprehensive cooperation now just a couple of words about this conference i thoroughly enjoyed the opening of the conference enjoyed the speeches of my climate change but are also facing pandemic and economic difficulties worldwide we are facing a rise of populism uncertainty and unpredictability 3 however on the one hand having all these problems we have also recognized here the issue on the other hand during the hundred years of development based on quantum technology and quantum physics we have achieved phenomenal achievements in science and technology and that technology today can resolve our problems be that in climate changes be that in covid and other problems that we are facing hing we should learn from the history of science when 100 years ago great scientists like albert einstein max planck and heisenberg realized that the classical laws of physics and mechanics could not be applied to the newly discovered small particles a nd atoms you have to change your mentality you have to change your philosophy your logic and even your common sense to understand and create the theory of quantum physics we are at a crossroads the world has become quantum this is a crossroad that we that was there 10 or 20 years ago if we change our mentality and form our ambition and strategy then we can effectively use the finances and the wealth that the wo rld created during this phenomenal development and use the technology to handle the problems that we are facing but not only to resolve the problems but also to create the basis of development to the brighter future years to come at the opening of this summit professor brian cox took us to a trip to cosmos to see from the above how amazingly beautiful this planet is and to realize that in the whole universe this is our home and the only one and there is no other alternative for us but to work and to fig ht for this green and blue planet armenia is committed to become a really smart state devoted to our nature planet a brighter future for all of us thank you ', '580 words there is cause for optimism  18 months ago we were staring into the abyss of a one in one hundred years pandemic the vaccines we would need had not only not been invented but there had never been a vaccine for a coronavirus but here we are billions vaccinated and the world is reclaiming what covid has taken from us the challenge of combating climate change will be met with the same way and it will be met by those who are largely not in this room  it will be our scientists technologists engineers entrepreneurs industrialists and financi ers that will chart this path to net zero and it is up to us as leaders to back them in technology will have the answers to a decarbonised economy over time and achieve it in a way that does not deny our citizens especially on developing economies t heir livelihoods or the opportunity for a better quality of life driving down the cost of technology and enabling it to be adopted at scale is at the core of the australian way to reach our target net zero emissions by 2050 that we are committing to at t his cop26 cleaner technology solutions must outcompete existing technologies if they are to be successful everywhere especially in developing economies this needs to work not just in the developed economies of the north atlantic but in the developing economies of the indo pacific as well raising the cost of the alternative just impacts on those who can least afford it driving the emergence of low  emissions technologies and fostering their widespread adoption is at the heart of all our plans to reach net zero carbon steel and aluminium energy storage carbon storage and soil carbon 90 per cent of commercial solar cells globally use austral ian technology australia has the best rates of rooftop solar in the world our installation of renewables is eight times faster than the global rate and three times faster than some of the most advanced economies we have already reduced emissions by more than 20 per cent since 2005 over the same time our economy has grown by 45 per cent proving that economic growth is not at odds with emissions reduction and by 2030 our nationally determined contribution here at cop26 notes t hat our emissions will fall by 35 by 2030 far exceeding our paris commitment and we are doubling our initial climate finance commitment for our pacific family and south east asian partners to 2 billion looking forward we are forging technology partner ships domestically and abroad  with singapore germany the uk japan korea and indonesia and we are close to concluding one with india australia is investing over 20 billion over the next decade to drive the transition leveraging private sector inv estment to reach 80 billion in total we are also working to establish high  integrity offsets internationally working with our close friends and neighbours in the indo  pacific the scene is set global momentum to tackle climate change is building coun tries with net zero commitments cover over 80 per cent of world gdp commitments our researchers scientists entrepreneurs investors and our people are ready  the australian way is to bet on them ', '1 cop 2 6  world leaders summit glasgow statement by he m r  alexander schallenberg federal chancellor republic of austria 2 check against delivery dear e xcellencies ladies and gentlemen thank you for the opportunity to address this distinguished group here today and t hank you p rime m inister johnson for convening all of us at this critical point in time for this critical purpose  our world is still in a state of emergency and if the past 18 months of the covid pandemic have reminded us of one thing then it is that in order to manage a global crisis effectively we all have to act fast and we have to act together  t he same goes for our fight against climate change and i can assure you that austria is determined to pla y its part together with our partners in europe and worldwide  domestic ally  in austria we are aiming at reaching net zero by 2040 with this ambitious aim in mind we strongly focus on the use of renewables currently we cover over 70 of our national electricity needs from renewable energy sources  our goal is to bring this to a 100 by 2030 and we intend to achieve this milestone without using nuclear energy  in our eyes  nuclear energy is neither safe nor sustainable another priority is carbon pricing we have just agreed a large  scale ecological turnaround as part of an eco  social tax reform  this eco  social tax reform lays the foundation for a certificate  based carbon pricing scheme in austria while also reducing the tax burden on low  and mid  income families and finally we are investing more in public transportation and energy efficiency than ever before in our history t hese domestic activities go hand in hand with our cooperation at eu and at international level we whole  hearted ly support a mbitious climate goals and the of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55  by 2030 as compared to 1990 with this  europe is setting an example and it is on track to becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050 we also fully one of the worlds leading contributor s of climate finance 3 a s austria we have recently increase d our contribution to the green climate fund by 100 million euros bringing our total share up to 130 million euros  however we have to be aware of one fact despite all our efforts across all government sectors be it at national regional or local level  we will fall short of our targets if we do not ensure the closest cooperation possible with the private sector  cooperation with the private sector is and will be critical to protect our climate because radical reductions in carbon emissions can only succeed through cooperation and innovation of course each and every one of us as individuals as families as societies  have a role to play to reduce our own carbon footprint but unless we change everything we do we will have to rely on new ways of doing only new sustainable forms of industrial production of transport technology  of consumption  of housing and also of forest management will enable us to become fully climate  neutral th e s e necessary innovation s  i am convinced can only come from close cooperation with the private sector from scientists and entrepreneurs alike and it is our task as political leaders to enable it and to support it wherever we can this is critical b ecause if we failed to do so we would risk a situation in which we had to choose between the economic health of our nations and the environmental health of our planet and i am sure that you all will agree with me that neither is an option ladies and gentlemen t he p rotection of our climate and our planet challenges  a challenge that we need to live up to with determination innovation and global cooperation we as austria stand ready t o work alongside all of you in the years to come to live up to this task  which history has placed before us  thank you ', 'speech by rauf hajiyev deputy minister of ecology and natural resources of the republic of azerbaijan 26th conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change november 10 2021  glasgow united kingdom dear chairman your excellency ladies and gentlemen i sincerely thank the government of u nited k ingdom for organizing this important event and for shown hospitality the geographical location complex and unique landscape  combining high mountains desert p lains and coastal zones make environment and sectors of its economy extremely sensitive to the effects of climate change the reduction of limited water resources by 15 percent over the past decades drought s  an increase in the frequency a nd intensity of hazardous atmospheric phenomena increase the sensitivity of our country to climate change at a time when the world is facing the threat of rising sea levels the level of the caspian sea  a unique reservoir in the region is declining th is negatively affects the biological resources of the caspian sea and all economic activities there  being a ware of all the seriousness of the problem azerbaijan is actively involved in to activities against climate change we have chosen the path of gre en development the country is implementing measures to expand forest areas increase the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficient technologies despite the fact that we are an oil and gas country azerbaijan has set a goal to increase the sha re of renewable energy sources in electricity production to 30 by 2030 at the same time we continue to expand the network of a modern early warning system to ensure resilience to hazardous hydrometeorological events we are open to regional cooperation in this area in the ndc we made an ambitious commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions for 35 until 2030 however the occupation  in the past of 20 of the territory of our country by armenia over the last 30 years the problems of 1 million refugees and internally displaced persons the destruction of flora and fauna natural resources in the occupied territories have seriously hampered the im plementation of the goals to mitigate the impact of climate change at a time when the world is fighting the consequences of climate change joining efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions calling for the protection of the planets forest cover the a rmenian occupation regime has destroyed a unique ecosystem on 20 of azerbaijans territory over the last three decades currently we have witnessed how tens of thousands of hectares of our forests were cut down and burned down by the occupation regime in the liberated territories today we look to the future a number of important decisions have been made to revive the liberated territories restoring these areas includes creating a green energy zone introducing green agriculture s mart cities and villages and rehabilitating large areas of forests for a collaborative effort to tackle the impact of climate change both regionally and globally we are pleased to announce the countrys new goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 40 by 2050 and create a zero  emission zone in the liberated territories of course these goals can only be achieved by providing access to modern technologies and the support of the relevant mechanisms of the unfccc  as well as international financial i nstitutions dear conference participants the only way to achieve a secure and sustainable future and reduce the negative impact of climate change is to consolidate efforts of all countries azerbaijan has already announced accession to a number of int ernational initiatives during cop 26 in support of efforts to reduce the impact of climate change concluding my speech i wish you good health and success in protecting our planet during this difficult period thank you for the attention ', ' 1 cop26 speech your royal highnesses your excellencies ladies and gentlemen for millennia technological and economic development moved at a steady pace that is until the advent of the industrial revolution which set in motion profound changes for mankind ushering in an era of change made on a previously unimaginable scale in the nineteenth century the vast majority of humanity experienced ex treme poverty today that figure stands at less than 10 percent two hundred years ago half of children born died before the age of five now less than four percent suffer this fate since then our progress led to the rise of a global order characteriz ed by economic interdependence which in turn brought stability to many regions of the world  sadly these feats however impressive came at a price for our planet and our collective duty is to ensure that it does not cost us the earth in doing so we must harness our productive potential with the same drive that greeted the dawn of the industrial age marshalling the might of innovation and human ingenuity to propel a greener and more prosperous world pause emissions reductions through investment i n renewable energy is certainly a central feature of this approach but even as we increase renewable energy mix for many years to come b illions of tons of carbon will need to be removed and sequestered each year if we are to arrive at net zero and limit warming to 15 degrees celsius pause 2 while the kingdom of bahrain is responsible for just 007 percent of global emissions we recognize not least as an island nation that climate change is a global challenge that requires global solutions developing the kinds of technologies necessary to meaningfully address the climate crisis requires us to both act in concert but also to lead by example today i am pleased to an nounce that bahrain is committed to reaching net zero by 2060 and has set a range of ambitious interim goals to ensure that we proceed without delay by 2035 we will reduce emissions by 30 percent through decarbonization and efficiency initiatives and dou ble our deployment of renewables from the targets we set at cop21  our 2035 targets also include carbon removal solutions by quadrupling mangrove coverage doubling tree coverage in bahrain and directly investing in carbon capture technologies  which we b elieve is essential  forums like cop26 and the recently concluded middle east green initiative serve as vital reminders of our shared interests and common future  we must take advantage of these opportunities to deliver on the promises we make and have ma de identifying multilateral solutions that vitally are accessible to all pause a future net  zero economy capable of propelling humanity to new heights depends entirely on the ability of all people to participate in it both as producers and as consumers we must therefore ensure that our work to curb emissions moves in lockstep with our work to improve livelihoods we owe it to posterity to leverage the achievements of the industrial age in order to deliver a cleaner more prosperous future th ank you ', ' 26 th session of the conference of the parties cop26 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc national statement by h e sheikh hasina

problems do not work we come to  glasgow with global ambition to save our people and our planet but now find three gaps on mitigation climate pledges or ndcs without more we will leave  the world on 27 degree pathway those commitments based on technologies yet to be developed are at best reckless and at worst  dangerous on finance we are 20 billion dollars short of the 100 and  this commitment might only be met in 2023 on adaptatio n  adaptation finance remains  only 25  not the 5050 split needed given the warming that is already taking place climate finance to frontline sids declined by 25 in 2019 failure to provide this critical finance and that of  loss and damage is measur ed in lives and livelihoods being lost  in our communities it is immoral and unjust if glasgow is to deliver on the promises of paris it must close these three gaps so i ask  what must we say to our people living on the frontline in the caribbean  africa and the pacific when both ambition and some of the needed faces are absent when will we as world leaders address the pressing issue s that are cause our people to worry be it climate or vaccines when will leaders lead our people are watching and taking note are we really going to leave scotland without the resolve and ambition that is sorely needed to save lives and to save our planet i have been saying to barbadians many hands make light work today we need the correct mix of voices and ambition do so me leaders believe they can survive and thrive on their own can there be peace and prosperity in one third of the world if two thirds are under siege and facing calamitous threats to their wellbeing what the world needs now is less than 200 persons who are willing and prepared to lead leaders must not fail those who elect them to lead there is a sword that can cut down this gordian knot it has been wielded before the central banks of the wealthiest countries engaged in 25 trillion dollars of qu antitative easing in 13 years 9 trillion in 18 months had we used the 25trn to purchase bonds that financed the energy transition we would be keeping within 15 degrees an annual increase in sdrs of 500bn for 20 years put in a trust to finance the transition is the real gap we need to close not the 50bn being proposed for adaptation if 500bn sounds big to you it is just 2 of that 25trn this is the sword we need to wield our excitement one hour into this event is far less than six months ago in the lead up the world stands at a fork in the road one no less significant than when the united nations was first created in 1945 will  we act in the interest of our people who are depending on us or will we allow the path of greed and selfis hness to sow the seeds of our common destruction leaders today not leaders in 2030 or 2050 must make this choice it is in our hands our people and our planet need it ', 'wls  opening ceremony remarks by mia amor mottley prime minister of barbados november 1 2021 the pandemic has taught us that national solutions to global problems do not work we come to  glasgow with global ambition to save our people and our planet but now find three gaps on mitigation climate pledges or ndcs without more we will leave  the world on 27 degree pathway those commitments based on technologies yet to be developed are at best reckless and at worst  dangerous on finance we are 20 billion dollars short of the 100 and  this commitment might only be met in 2023 on adaptatio n  adaptation finance remains  only 25  not the 5050 split needed given the warming that is already taking place climate finance to frontline sids declined by 25 in 2019 failure to provide this critical finance and that of  loss and damage is measur ed in lives and livelihoods being lost  in our communities it is immoral and unjust if glasgow is to deliver on the promises of paris it must close these three gaps so i ask  what must we say to our people living on the frontline in the caribbean  africa and the pacific when both ambition and some of the needed faces are absent when will we as world leaders address the pressing issue s that are cause our people to worry be it climate or vaccines when will leaders lead our people are watching and taking note are we really going to leave scotland without the resolve and ambition that is sorely needed to save lives and to save our planet i have been saying to barbadians many hands make light work today we need the correct mix of voices and ambition do so me leaders believe they can survive and thrive on their own can there be peace and prosperity in one third of the world if two thirds are under siege and facing calamitous threats to their wellbeing what the world needs now is less than 200 persons who are willing and prepared to lead leaders must not fail those who elect them to lead there is a sword that can cut down this gordian knot it has been wielded before the central banks of the wealthiest countries engaged in 25 trillion dollars of qu antitative easing in 13 years 9 trillion in 18 months had we used the 25trn to purchase bonds that financed the energy transition we would be keeping within 15 degrees an annual increase in sdrs of 500bn for 20 years put in a trust to finance the transition is the real gap we need to close not the 50bn being proposed for adaptation if 500bn sounds big to you it is just 2 of that 25trn this is the sword we need to wield our excitement one hour into this event is far less than six months ago in the lead up the world stands at a fork in the road one no less significant than when the united nations was first created in 1945 will  we act in the interest of our people who are depending on us or will we allow the path of greed and selfis hness to sow the seeds of our common destruction leaders today

ireland your excellences l adies and gentlemen the republic of belarus along with other countries is implementing international initiatives to combat climate change in september 2021 the republic of belarus committed itself to make a new nationally determined contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 the country will use domestic resource s to redu ce emissions by 35 per cent attracting additional external funding will increase the ambition of our contribution and lay the foundation for the countrys further achievement of carbon neutrality in a time frame comparable to goals declared by the worlds leading industrial countries less than 02 per cent we are responsible for the commitments we made and are striving to join our efforts with other nations no coal is extracted or used in the country the main share of the energy sources in the republic of belarus is natural gas in 2022 with the commissioning of the belarusian nuclear power plant with the state investments worth more than 10 billion us dol lars  greenhouse gas emi ssions will be reduced by 8 per cent and gas consumption will begin to decline t he share of renewable energy in the total energy balance is already more than 9 percent belarus has practical experience in implementing de  risking pro jects in green energy area attracting private investors  along with the development of l ow  carbon energy the country has been rehabilitating drained peatlands ecological rehabilitation of 1 hectare prevents emission of 11 tonnes of co2 currently there are 15 million hectares of drained peatlands in belarus therefore to accelerate the process of their swamping it is necessary to join efforts and raise financing for these projects in the framework of all  european environmental programmes belarus has enormous regional carbon absorption potential thanks to our f orests which cover 40 per co2 emissions taking care of forests is not only a state policy but also a long  established cultural trad ition of the belarusians every year our residents plant a million trees with their own hands we welcome the intentions of the signatories to the cop26 joint declaration on forests and land use and share the principles laid down therein designed to halt the loss of forests in the world 2 distinguished delegates in our world the environmental well  being and health of every human being should become a top priority of modern international policy and to address these challenges countries must work together to combat climate change by bridging the existing political and economic divides thank you for your attention ', '', 'statement by the chairman of the presidency of bosnia and herzegovina dear prime minister johnson distinguished presidents prime ministers and members of delegations of all countries representatives of the non  governmental sector ladies and gentlemen it is a great pleasure to be here today and to have the opportunity to greet you all at this imp ortant conference on climate change this conference takes place at a time when we daily face the consequences of the covid 19 pandemic and series of climate challenges that pose a difficult task for the future of the whole world that is why it is important to reach an agreement on how to accelerate global action against climate change in order to maintain the global temperature increase below 15°c and prevent climate change from spiraling out of control each of our countries faces different cha llenges regardless of that it is necessary to be on the same page in the fight against the climate crisis and to act together it is also necessary to set realistic and achievable goals significant financial resources will be needed to implement those goals especially in countries with lower gdp per capita such as bosnia and herzegovina my country is making efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however in the coming period we will have to invest more energy and more funds in order to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves i am pleased to share with you today that bosnia and herzegovina submitted its updated nationally determined c ontribution ndc to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc in april this year reaffirming its commitment to fulfilling the paris climate agreement by submitting this document bosnia and herzegovina becomes one of the first countries in the western balkans to adopt an updated ndc with a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 332 by 2030 and almost 66 by 2050 in order to meet our goals of climate change prevention we are also working to enable the transition to sustainability and creating an attractive environment for private sector investment in clean affordable energy we will need substantial international assistance in the areas of technology transfer and development of financial mechanisms to encourage decarbonisation the same goes for financial support to the climate issues projects with the goal of further decarbonisation of the energy sector bosnia and herzegovina signed the sofia declaration on the green agenda for the western balkans in november 2020 bih thus committed to work together with the eu to make europe a climate  neutral continent b y 2050 in that regard one of our current most important activities is the development of the integrated national energy and climate plan for the period 2021  2030 necp bih that document aligns multiple objectives those of the european union in the fie ld of energy and climate those of the united nations framework convention on climate change the paris agreement and the energy community our plan in bosnia and herzegovina will define goals for improving the energy efficiency measures increasing the share of renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 it will also include the policies and measures to achieve those goals we aim to set ambitious goals for each of the dimensions of the plan which we believe are realistic to be achieved by 2030 and which will enable further development of the energy sector of bosnia and herzegovina i would like to emphasize that within the development of the national energy and climate plan bosnia and herzegovina is also working on the de velopment of a coal region transition road map such transition of the coal regions and the entire energy sector in bosnia and herzegovina has to be a fair one it must provide for the switch from coal to renewable energy sources without any loss of jobs regarding the energy sector defining ways to finance the energy transition is of the utmost importance for bosnia and herzegovina the energy transition will require significant investment in low  carbon technologies and infrastructure bosnia and herzego vina like many other countries will need substantial international financial assistance and support for the decarbonisation of the energy sector by 2050 special focus must be on the planned closure of coal mines and the shutdown of coal  fired power plan ts there is no doubt that bosnia and herzegovina wishes to contribute to the fight against climate change however we will not be able to do this alone we need the support we have to cooperate with the countries that can accelerate this process with their knowledge and resources regardless of the fact that i do not represent a country with a large population it will be necessary for everyone to contribute to the efforts to stop climate change you can certainly count on us thank you for your attention  i wish everyone a successful continuation of the conference which i hope the history will remember as a milestone in the fight to save our planet thank you ', 'mr president honorable heads of state and government honorable ministers ladies and gentlemen it is an honor to be here representing brazil at this important conference of the parties in glasgow i thank on behalf of our delegation for the kind reception and i congratulate the cop26 team for the organization i n our case this effort was mutual  because brazil also received glasgow we set up an interactive structure and promoted the participation of 10 ministers of state connected in real time to our pavilion here in glasgow demonstrating the integrated action of the brazilian government in t he international climate agenda thus it was also possible to present cases of a real brazil in several panels this is part of a great er effort with already clear outcomes  brazil as a key player in the negotiations made important moves during the fi rst days and we announced even more ambitious climate targets 50 reduction in emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 eliminate illegal deforestation by 2028 and support the global methane reduction we proactively gave clear signs that brazil is part of the solution to overcome this global challenge to reduce emissions brazil is gigantic by nature so our actions reflect the proportions of our territory and our people our low  carbon agriculture has already restored nearly 28 million hectare s of degraded pastures and will increase th is number to 58 million by 2030 we have the worlds largest biofuels operational program our renewable energies contribute to 84 of our electricity matrix generating a record of 380 thousand jobs in solar and wind we have 16 million hectares of native forests in recovery and our solid waste management program has already reduced the number of dumps ites by 20 we particularly highlight the águas brasileiras program which aims to plant 100 million trees in t he cerrado pantanal and caatinga biomes also the new basic sanitation framework which gives the opportunity for the private sector to provide wastewater treatment to over 100 million people also the incredible transformation from the logistical modal to rail roads  with more than 5000 km of new rails representing a 75 reduction in emissions of gee in cargo transport and equating the brazilian modal to that of developed countries results like these demonstrate the strength of the current and real br azilian environmental policy but the government of brazil wants more less than a month ago we launched the foundations of the national green growth program to give priority to green initiatives whether public or private aimed at reducing emissions forest conservation and rational use of natural resources hence contributing to the generation of green jobs the program already includes resources from federal banks in the order of 50 billion dollars we recognize our challenges and have been working to overcome them to contain illegal deforestation in the amazon the federal government doubled the resources allocated to federal environ mental agencies and is going to hire 739 new environmental agents in addition the ministry of justice col l aborates with 700 men in the field working in 23 municipalities in an ostensible and permanent way the ministry of defense through censipam rece ntly launched an innovative and even more accurate forest monitoring system we also recognize that where there is a lot of forest there is also a lot of poverty and to promote sustainable development in the region we created the national program for p ayments for environmental services floresta which seeks to promote the market for environmental services recognizing and providing payments to those who take care of the forest at this cop and even long before we get here our delegation has been work ing to achieve positive results in creating a global carbon market under article 6 understanding brazils role in building bridges between the different parties and its potential as an exporter of carbon credits  contribut ing to a more balanced global red uction it is important that developed countries recognize the financial emergency and mobilize the necessary resources to achieve the desired goals at this conference the 100 billion target was not met and currently this figure is no longer sufficient for the world to build a new green economy with a responsible transition more ambitious volumes are needed with easy access and agile execution so that the transformation takes place in an inclusive way in each territory around the world mainly in regi ons that are more vulnerable in terms of climate and economic development t he countries that are historically and currently responsible for the largest volumes of emissions must demonstrate their effective funding ambitions at this conference without fu rther postponing a commitment made in 2015 and so far not fully realized all parties of this conference must take on their common but differentiated responsibilities towards a green economy neutral in emissions  the global challenge to be overcome is to revert the negative logic of punishment sanction and prohibition to the positive logic of incentive innovation and prioritization it is necessary to transform the environmental agenda into an opportunity to generate green jobs based on a constructive vision we will find the way to create the sustainable future we all want the green future has already started in brazil  thank you

main goals  accelerated further development of renewable energy sources and hydrogen  increase of the energy efficiency of the economy and sustainable mobility a ll the measures that will lead to the green transition are carried out in the economic reality of today  the reality of an unprecedented pan demic and rising energy prices o ur main concern is the risk of job losses and the energy

because climate change is no longer a hearsay 3 climate change like pandemics has no border and our presence here signifies shared concerns and reassurance that as world leaders we are not losing sight of our shared responsibility for climate action 4 cambodia feels the crises directly and takes them seriously  to prevent the spread an d mitigate the impacts of covid  19  w e have comprehensive vaccination  strict health and social measures being put in place  still  new variants remain a threat making our socio  economic recovery challenging s uch crises require stronger

total biomass is bigger than ever before 9 we are i ncreasing share of clean energy  not developing any new coal power plants and not constructing any new hydropower dam along the mekong river 10 we are also for mulating a long  term strategy for carbon neutrality to promote activities that can deliver low carbon climate resilient and inclusive growth this also will help us seize the

agreement updated ndcs have shown increased climate ambition  l arge economies have set net zero emissions targets  private and public investments in green technologies have rise n 12 still  we remain concerned that the level of commitments falls far short of the 15°c target which puts us on a dangerous path particular ly for the post  c ovid recovery in ldc s 13 i nternational climate finance is also far from the required scale particularly for adaptation and difficult to access for the most climate vulnerable countries we call for developed countries to increase their contributions to financial mechanisms under the convention and to further f acilitate direct access to the funds otherwise  promoting sustainable and climate resilient infrastructures disaster management capabilities  and low  carbon development in ldcs would barely be an empty talk  14 we expect this cop to address these issues so pledges become action s  we also hope the paris agreement implementation guidelines  including a strong set of rules for carbon markets under article 6  will be finalized here  to encourage forest protection and promote sustainable financing for adaptation and mitigation activities 15 now that w e enter the crucial decade of action en visioned by the paris agreement i t is not a time for hesitation or half  measures  but for ambition decisiveness and implementation 16 i hope cop26

of climate change are much more severe than anybody ever imagined achieving the 15  degree threshold as defined by the ipcc is a therefore a must and cop26 must deliver the 1 5  degree goal is unattainable without redd and  dramatically slowing global deforestation is needed and the redd mechanism is singularly designed to achieve that goal article 5 of the paris agreement define s redd as the only mechanism to implement forestry activities whether it is deforestation degradation or conservation redd is our north star  it is based on a set of decisions that have been agreed and are now being implemented  developing countries are now hard at work on article 5 which should not be re  opened  our work to date should not be disrupted mr president environmental integrity must be at the core of our work and the glasgow outcome must be built on this principle redd dec isions already ensure a high level of environmental integrity and all other sectors should be based on the same rules  notably national ghg inventorie s and national reference levels  the papua new guinea on behalf of the coalition for rainforest nations same stringency should be reflected in article 6 guidance as this is a critical condition for the private sector to engage with the paris agreement the last elements of the enhanced transparency framework created by the paris agreement must include clear and simple decisions that are consistent with previously agreed rul es  emission reductions or removals not included in our ndcs national monito ring system and ghg inventor ies must not qualify for international transfer  mr president rainforest nations have already delivered more than 9gts of ghg emissions reductions  this is an astounding figure and proof that the redd mechanism has been of immediate benefit these actions deserve to be adequately rewarded so that we can continue to effectively address the global climate emergency  for th is reason we call for clarity that redd results are included in the definition of itmos as agreed back in katowice agreed redd mrv is concurrent to the new transparency process  to avoid redundancy  the rules on article 62 must be consistent with this approach  mr president adaptation is of ut most importance for our countries we must agree on a clear plan to define the global goal on adaptation  adaptation finance should not be a small percentage of mitigation it s hould be real  predictable and at scale finance for adaptation projects should come exclusively from developed countries  as article 62 is a critical tool allowing countries to fulfill their ndcs it should include incentives for early  pre  2020 redd actions and should only include activities inside their respective ndcs  this is the only way to reach the 15c

and g entlemen allow me at the outset to convey my deep appreciation and sincere congra tulations to the government of the united kingdom for hosting cop26  as well as the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change for organising this extremely important and timely conference for averting the challenges associated with clima te change challenges that are global and can only be mitigated if we all act together with a sense of utmost urgency and joint commitment towards enhancing joint action and accelerating global transformation to a low carbon and climate resilient societ y our target towards this goal was clearly identified six years ago at cop21 in paris  when we collectively pledged to cut greenhouse emissions so as to limit global warming to 15 degrees celsius compared with pre  industrial times 2 however currentl y and we have to be honest so as to strengthen our efforts in fulfilling our promises there is no sign that we are growing back greener since not only planetary warming is accelerating but we are witnessing around the globe protracted heat waves devas tating fires and deforestation increased water scarcity droughts floods and extreme weather patterns that is why i have no doubt that cop26 can and should prove to be the historic milestone in the efforts to address the said devastating impacts by e nsuring the highest possible commitment from all participating countries in a way that is fair efficient and transparent whilst maintaining solidarity towards vulnerable countries that will be severely affected for these exact reasons cyprus fully en dorses and supports the initiatives and declarations of cop26  namely 1 2 the global coal  to  clean power transition statement  3 3 the d eclaration on accelerating the transition to 100 zero emission cars and vans  4 as well as the us initiative the global methane pledge initiative and the greening government initiative further in addition to our commitment to adhering to the targets of the said declarations and initiatives  cyprus also rem ains fully committed to take all necessary measures so as to achieve the paris agreement and the eu targets  with the aim of achieving a 55 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050 to this end and as a first step in accomplishing these ambitious but highly  needed goals my country will allocate more than 500 million euro up until 2026 adopting new policies and measures as regards using cleaner fuels  such as natural g a s and renewable energy sources  and promoting n ecessary investments in the relevant areas of transport a griculture i ndustry la nd u se and f orestry and w aste m anagement 4 ladies and gentlemen honourable guests as a small country  we do acknowledge that our national contribution towards tackling t he impacts of climate change is indeed limited we  therefore seek to enhance regional cooperation through coordinated synergies and sharing best practices  taking into account that the mediterranean and middle east is classified as a ange hot  within this framework we have undertaken the initiative of developing a regional action plan  with the involvement of more than 240 scientists from our wider region  as well as various i nternational o rganisations  who are already prepari ng policy recommendations measures and specific solutions with the finalisation of the scientific part of the action plan which will establish the foundations of our future steps within the coming months we will hold a ministerial meeting and a leader that will initiate appropriate coordination and monitoring mechanisms for the implementation of our commitments 5 dear f riends we are compelled and people expect from us to take on urgent action to address climate change and i am certain tha t you will agree with me that the time to act is upon us our vision should be none other than to look to the future with optimism and to use the climate challenge as an opportunity to proudly demonstrate what all countries what humanity can achieve wh en we join forces  i have no doubt that by decisively cooperating and acting together  with unity and greater urgency we will be able to overcome the dire consequences of a warming planet and bring forward the necessary changes for a sustainable future so as for our generation and the coming ones to

despite the covid  19 p andemic limitations and related uncertainties  eswatini believes that you and the secretariat braved such odds to present the sense of urgency on the need to accelerate mitigation ambition during this critical decade  in order to keep the 15 degrees celsius in reach in line with the paris agr eement temperature goal we pledge our support to you and my 2 delegation is committed to involvement in all deliberations to ensure a successful outcome of this conference  includ ing the completion of the rules governing the implementation of paris agreement mr  president the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change report shows that 15 d egrees celsius of global warming is likely to occur and eswatini together with all of southern africa warms at twice the global rate we therefore can expect that the sadc region will experience nor less than a 3 celsius warming  this is happening amidst the extreme weather events already experienced such as heatwaves floods and droughts the w arnings are clear that these events will dramatically increase in intensity and frequency over the coming years the livelihoods of emaswati depend heavily on agriculture  which suffered the drastic effects of cyclone eloise  s uch extreme weather patterns have resulted in a dramatic decline in agricultural production despite the restrictions caused by the covid 19 pandemic eswatini is taking bold action to address climate change with significant national resources being allocated to adaptation and mitigation actions in a balanced approach we understand the urgency of climate action and have adopted policies and programmes such as the nat ional climate change policy national development strategy and the covid  19 economic recovery strategy which incorporate robust climate action we have pledged to considerably raise investment in and access to renewable energy to the population by increasing the share of renewable energy to 50 in the electricity mix by 2030 relative to 2010 levels through the adoption of solar wind biomass hydro and solar water heater technologies 3 mr president developing countries especially africa includ ing small states like eswatini are ready to transform their economies however without the much needed adequate predictable and accessible financial support this remains an impossible task for us we therefore emphasize the importance of the delivery of support for developing countries including through the fulfilment of the developed country goal of jointly mobilizing us100 billion per year by 2020 and annually through to 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implem entation and delivering a significant increase in finance for adaptation  mr president eswatini continues to fully support the effective implementation of the paris agreement and has submitted her enhanced and ambitious updated national determined contributions ndcs which focus on all sectors this is despite the fact that as a n ation we contribute as little as 0007 share to the global ghg emissions we call upon all parties to be as transparent and communicate their new or u pdated ndcs of highest possible ambition and long  term strategies that set out a pathway towards net zero in order to keep the targeted 15 degree celsius objective of the paris agreement mr president as this cop calls for the world to collectively respond to the climate change challenge in the unfccc is restricted to the very limited quota of an ngo and it is still being denied the opportunity to submit its ambitious ndcs to the unfccc 4 secretariat this contradicts the spirit of the second un principle of living no one behind responding to climate change requires solidarity and courage for the unfccc to be effective we plead that taiwan be afforded the opportunit y to participate in global mechanisms negotiations and activities that promote the implementation of the paris agreement taiwan exhorts all parties to look beyond political considerations and participation in the unfccc we therefore register our call for taiwan help do its part in the global fight against climate change

first step towards something bigger ladies and gentlemen  your time is the time of the people you know and love the time that moulds you and your time is also the time of the people you will know and love the time that you will shape everything you do matters you create the future every single day th ese a re the words of an icelandic author magnason and h is words are true the time to create the future is now today young people are pressing for actions  we must heed their call  i also want to underscore the importance of gender equality in our discourse  we must involve women and girls in all aspects of climate action and decisions we need the energy and ingenuity of all of humankind the signs of climate disruption are ominous we see emergencies around the world that are a direct consequence of the climate crisis in iceland we see our glaciers receding  w e worry about the change of chemistry and circulation in our oceans in ways that could disrupt the entire marine ecosystem  but there are also signs of progress tha t give ground for hope and optimism the promise of the paris agreement is alive and well i sense great ambition and will here in glasgow there is demanding work ahead but it can be good work as well  green transition can and must be the growth story of the 21st century and save the day and the planet thank you ', 'in the name of god mr president executive secretary of unfccc honorable ministers distinguished delegates ladies and gentlemen it is indeed a pleasure to be present in this august meeting fir s t of all  i would like to inform that my president his ex c e l lency dr mahammad ebrahim raisi was very much willing to a t tend this summit for not only his personal attachment to climate change and environmental issues  b u t also for the legal obligations according on domestic laws and regulation of my government to protect the collective right to clean and protect environment of iranian nation  however on his behalf i would like to exten d his best wishes for the success of this conference  mr president the government of islamic republic of iran is committ ed al on gsi de with other nations to combat climate change and global warming with the full support of the s up reme l eader  the government and iranian environment department whose head is of the rank of vice president devise a very amb i t iou s national plan to cope with the con se quences of climate change however mr  president  when it comes the international cooperation and all stakeholders globally unfortunately my country faces an obstacle which is economic terrorism  mr president we are facing a relevant questions raised by members of parliament when they are in the legal pro cess of ratification of paris a greement that question is if the islamic republic of iran becomes the full member of p aris agreement while unilateral coer c ive sanction or measures are imposed on the whole country of iran how the government would be able to imp l ement its commitments if it is un able to receive any international assistance being financial or technical assistance from international community that question still remains unanswered and i put the same question before you mr president and all member state arou n d thi s table why blind coercive measures are imposed on my country and few others which not only are inflicting sufferings on a nation but also is undermining the global efforts to combat climate change to the benefit of the humanity  this is the sad long story of taking human issues as a hostage for political objective of a few if not one thank you  mr president ', 'national statement by the taoiseach cop 26 glasgow 2 november 2021 excellencies people we come here as leaders and it is vital that we offer the leadership the world now urgently needs climate change is real we are seeing its serious impacts already the ipcc report in august confirmed to us that it is widespread it is rapid and it is intensifying the scale of this change is unprecedented but as the report made cl ear it is not too late human actions still have the potential to determine the future course of climate the very future of our planet to achieve our paris goals immediate large  scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are essential unless we ac t now we will not keep the possibility of limiting warming to 1 5 degrees alive page  2 the scientists are playing their part in helping us to understand the dynamics of climate change and in developing the technologies and responses we need to limit its effect  as political leaders it is our responsibility to put the necessary policies in place ireland is ready to play its part we have enacted legislation to put a legally binding target of reducing our emissions by 2030 to 51 below 2018 levels we will reach climate neutrality by 2050 we are working closely with our eu partners in the green transition that will make europe the first climate  neutral continent we are implementing a statutory system of carbon budgeting and emissions ceilings for each sector of the economy page  3 we are working at the un security council to put the destabilising impacts of climate change firmly on the agenda we do not believe or accept as some would have it that it is too late that the transition will be too costly that it is inevitable that we will leave people behind that someone else should shoulder the load we believe in the immense capacity of humans to work together and to achieve great things if we act decisively now we will offer humanity the most valuable pri ze of all a liveable planet we can achieve a cooler world a biodiverse world a world with healthier air for us to breathe healthier soil for things to grow in a world in which people can live more sustainable lives handing a healing and enriched p lanet to future generations we can create a world in which human impact on all parts of our ecosphere the land the sea the air  is brought back into balance page  4 those of us in the developed world those who have frankly contributed most to the prob lems that confront us all have an obligation to support those who are most acutely challenged by their consequences ireland accepts that obligation in support of achieving the 100bn target i am therefore pleased to announce today that ireland will m ore than double its contribution to developing countries  so that we are delivering year by 2025 as leaders if we are to bring people with us on this journey of a lifetime we must also recognise and respect the real anxiety that many people feel when confronted by such an enormous challenge our young people worry that there will be no worthwhile fu ture for them to inherit workers worry that their jobs will disappear leaving them without a livelihood page  5 consumers already feeling the impact of energy price rises feel that the transition will be too costly for them to bear in response i say i will do everything in my power working with all of the leaders here today to make sure that it is not so to ensure that we will succeed in limiting emissions to ensure that the transition we deliver is jobs  rich and economically sustainable to ensure tha t there is real climate justice and nobody in any part of the world is left behind the ipcc report made it clear that every tonne of carbon warms the world every second of delay makes our task that bit bigger let us leave glasgow with a renewed comm itment to doing what we know needs to be done let us move forward together now ', 'prime minister johnson excellencies colleagues ladies and gentlemen the speeches we have just heard resonate deeply with me over the last few years young people have done us a service by bringing the climate agenda to the front of our political debate young people were at the centre of the pre  cop summit in milan in glasgow here we need to make them proud the projected r ise in global temperatures is set to affect dramatically life on our planet coral reefs to the loss of biodiversity the impact of climate change is already all too evident its p rice is also rising fast especially for poorer nations the cost of disruptions for households and companies in low  and middle  income countries amounts to a staggering 390 billion dollars a year climate change also has serious repercussions on global p eace and security it can deplete natural resources and worsen social tensions lead to new migration flows and contribute to terrorism and organized crime climate change can tear us apart thanks to constant dialogue and cooperation we have made good progress on addressing climate change the g20 accounts for around 75 of global greenhouse gas emissions and around 80 of global gdp limit the rise in global temperature to 15 de grees this was the first time and committed to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid  century we decided to step up our actions starting from this decade enhance our nationally determined contributions and stop the international public funding of unabated new coal by the end of this year here at cop26 we must now go further than we did at the g20 we need to speed up our commitment to keep the rise in temperature below 15 degrees we need to build on the g20 agreement and act faster and more dec isively we must strengthen our efforts in the realm of climate finance we must bring together the public and the private sector in new ways we have the roadmap put forward by prince charles prime minister johnson highlighted the amount of private money an intelligent way to spend them and spend them quickly we need first and foremost all multilateral development banks and especially the world bank to co  share with the private sector the risks that the private sector alone cannot bear we need country  based platforms where the world bank and other multilateral development banks can actually co  share and make all this money useable for a good cause  th is is the first in a sense great news that prime minister johnson gave us today that money is not a concern if we want to use it well this cop26 must be the start of a new momentum a quantum leap in our fight against climate change and our youth mu st be at the centre of this process feature of all cops future generations will judge us for what we achieve or fail to achieve we must involve them listen to

pandemic demonstrated the need for equity  equity must also be at the heart of our response to climate change page 3 of 4 countries that have profited the most from carbon over decades have a responsibility to provide others with resources and technology to transition to low carbon economies this was the basis of the us100 billion a year pledge from developed countries at the copenhagen

for welco ming this historic conference and let me thank the dedicated people from across the world who have steadily focused on means to counter the climate threat  but our gathering here is evidence that the larger internatio nal effort has not been enough we see this not only in extreme events firestorms  flooding  deadly landslides but we also see it in the inch  by  inch loss of healthy ess ential environment  lands and waters that are the lifeblood of billions of people  the middle east has been among the hardest  hit regions in jordan reduced rainfalls and high evaporation have combined to a deadly effect the jordan river is a shadow of what the bible and our forefathers depicted the dead sea is d ropping by more than half a met r e a year freshwater aquifers are dwindling and their salinity rising  all this compound s our extreme water scarcity  already under pressure because of massive r efugee flows this is why jordan is committed to the climate chan ge fight when jordan joined the paris agreement in 2015 we set a target of a 14  percent carbon reduction by 2030 and now we aim to double it over the next nine years with your help t o achieve this we have identified 32 emission  reduction projects with a total cost of 76 billion dollars the work has begun jordan has been a regional pioneer in renewable energy clean mobility and other green technologies we have worked closely with the green  tech industry  and we welcome continued partnership numerous solar and wind projects are up and running and this sector will continue to grow as we plan to export electricity to neighbouring countries we are closing the water loop thr ough the optimal use of highly treated wate r and advanced farming methods other initiatives will enhance our resiliency in key areas such as disaster mitigation carbon recapture food security and waste management we are embarking on an ambitious fore station effort to plant 10 million trees over the next 10 years within our protected areas and we are taking steps to care for a unique marine resource  our resilient coral reefs in the gulf of aqaba we have designated a protected nature reserve and wi th your support will be able to leverage learnings about effective climate change mitigation and adaptation by establishing a marine science and research park in aqaba to help marine areas at risk across the globe and increase knowledge sharing on water  energy and environmental research in all our efforts international partners have been and will be essential a key part of this is cop  26 support for

on the item on special nee ds and special circumstances of africa  kenya notes that despite the fact that the african continent has very low historical and current emissions accounting for about 4 of global emissions ipcc reports demonstrate that africa is h ighly vulnerable and impacted by climate change these have led to increased water stress cyclic floods and droughts food insecurity population displacem ents resource based conflicts among others africa has r esource and technical constraints in addressing these vulnerabil ities in this light kenya supports the inclusion of the item on special needs and special circumstances of africa to guide in addressing these needs 3 regarding the pending items of the paris rule book  we need to ensure that we finalise it at this ses sion a on the item on common time  frames  we need to respond to the scientific evidence that shows that more ambitious emissions reduction is required if we are to achieve the paris agreement goal of 15 0 c  we need to avoid locking  in low ambition over a l ong period of time  in the basic structure of the paris agreement the common thread that runs through the paris agreement both in ndc and global stocktake is a 5  year cycle  in this regard kenya therefore appeals to parties to agree on a 5  year common time frame b on matters relating to article 6 of the paris agreement i kenya supports the use of cooperative approaches referred to in article 6 paragraph 2 with the application of corresponding adjustments to avoid double counting in the use of itmos towards ndcs and for other purposes outside the ndcs  for consistency purposes the itmos should be measured in tco 2 e and be in the form of emissions by sources and removals including by sinks there is need for a share of proceeds  preferably of 5 to the adaptation fund to address concrete adaptation needs of vulnerable populations at the grassroots ii regarding the mechanism established by article 6 paragraph 4 kenya supports the transition of kyoto protocol mechanism cdm projects and programme of activities into the new article 64 mechanism subject to meeting art 64 requirements as well as the host party authorization and that they should undergo an expedited registration process kenya supports the application of corresponding adjustment for art icle 64 units that are internationally transferred and that activities with removals by sinks should be included kenya reiterates the need for the application of the share of proceeds levied from art 6 to be towards the adaptation fund iii regarding the f ramework for non  market approaches referred to in article 6 paragraph 8 kenya supports the establishment of a concrete implementation framework to implement the framework and work programme under non  market approaches  market act ivities can include forestry activities that unlock funding from payment for ecosystem services pes kenya supports the development of implementing tools for example a unfccc web  based platform for exchanging information   mark et approaches can build on the outputs of koronovia joint work on agriculture such as methodologies that can lead to replicable and scalable projects and programmes across parties c on reporting under the transparency framework in order to spur confidenc e and provide the desired leadership in climate action kenya reiterates that developed countries have an overarching obligation to adequately and transparently report climate finance provided and mobilized as well as their greenhouse inventories in a tim e overall there is need to clear existing ambiguity in the climate finance architecture around the definition modalities and methodologies used in order to enhance transparency in reporting 4 concerning the items on market and non  market mechanisms under the convention finalized and proposes that they be deferred to sbsta 56 once article 6 is agreed on parties will still need to deliberate whether to conclude it or what it will d o moving forward without overlapping with article 6 5 regarding climate finance  t he determination of needs of developing countries should inform the on  going discussions in setting the new post  2025 climate finance goal to enable it respond to needs of dev eloping countries cop 26 should initiate the post  2025 new collective goal on climate finance based on these needs as well as science  the report should set precedence to a new era of needs  based and impactful climate financing  reporting on financial su pport provided and mobilized by developed countries should reflect the actual support received for climate action in developing countries including the instruments kenya is concerned that developed countries have not delivered on the 100bn per year fina nce goal and any efforts post  2020 should deliver on the short falls so far and meet the 100bn per year through to 2025 6 regarding on the koronivia joint work on agriculture kenya welcomes all the workshop reports on the koronivia joint work on agricult ure road map this far and is ready to engage on the actionable recommendations thereof for implementation and institutionalization of the kjwa  however on modalities for implementation of the workshop outcomes of the previous workshops the kjwa topics an d the future topics kenya expresses her disappointment that discussions on the subject have been strong on technical aspects and less on implementation  kenya calls upon all parties to consider the critical importance that agriculture plays in our economi es livelihoods and in ensuring food security and agree on modalities to support the implementation of the outcomes of the past ten workshops since 2013 to date kenya therefore calls for adoption of a cop decision at cop26 that i establishes kjwa as a c onstituted body or committee under the convention or ii establishes an international agriculture program within the unfccc process or iii requests for establishment of a requests for proposals rfp mechanism under the green climate fund gcf that set s aside a sum of money dedicated to support developing countries to submit proposals geared towards implementation of the outcomes of the kjwa on issues related to agriculture or iv a combination of both the three above kenya subsequently proposes that kjwa future topics  should be s ubject to adoption of a cop decision on modalities for implementation of the workshop outcomes so as to ensure that there is a balance between technical work and implementation of its outcomes 7 on the forum on the impact of t he implementation of response measures kenya proposes that the kci should provide a support infrastructure to enable experts carry out technical assessments of impacts of the response measures kenya proposes that parties should develop mechanisms for i retooling and retraining of workers and professions affected by response measures ii  cushion developing countries that have fossil fuel resources from lost opportunities due to forgoing the exploitation of fossil fuel resources in order to avoid the an ticipated greenhouse gas emissions iii cushion developing countries that had invested in infrastructure to exploit their fossil fuels so as to relieve them of the dead assets burden ivcushion consumers of goods that may become expensive to the consume rs as a result of new or expensive technology alternatives to high emitting bau grey technologies v incentivize the creation of green well paying jobs profitable businesses affordable quality green products and strengthen the associated value chains 8 concerning the warsaw international mechanism for loss and damage associated with climate change impacts  kenya c alls for scaled up new and additional finance for loss and damage with separate accountingreporting modalities kenya recognises the impact o f loss and damag e on women youth children people abled differently and other vulnerable groups and call for integration both the cop and cma but not limited to cma alone it building to include resource mobilisation for loss and damage we therefore call for full operationalization of the santiago network to enable it to cataly se the technical assistance to developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change to tackle loss and damage there is need to enhance the n to develop and implement approaches to address loss and damage 9 regarding the local communities and indigenous peoples platform kenya reiterates the value of indigenous knowledge in addressing climate change especially in the african context kenya ca lls for the completion of items in the work plan and urges parties to consider support for the implementation of the outcomes talk  shop 10 on matters relating to the adaptatio n fund concerning the membership of the adaptation fund board kenya welcomes the decision that allowed all parties that are parties to the paris agreement to be eligible for membership on the adaptation fund board however kenya feels that this inclusio n should not alter the current balance in the composition of the board where developing country parties are the majority  kenya therefore feels that there is no need to reconsider the structure of the afb regarding the fourth review of the adaptation fun d here is need to carry out a comprehensive backward and forward looking review of the af  so as  to i reflect lessons le arnt and chart a way forward ii  strengthen the af secretariat operations to effectively serve the pa and keny a feels that there is need to focus on strengthening af regional engagements with regional nodes to support establishment and strengthening of nies 11 on the development and transfer of technologies kenya reiterates the importance of technology as a key pil lar to climate action regarding the joint annual report of the technology executive committee and the climate technology centre and network kenya welcomes the 2020 joint annual report jar of the technology mechanism tm and acknowledges the achievemen ts of the tm in the difficult period under review including the encouraging outcome of the collaboration between the technology mechanism and the operating entities of the financial mechanism among other achievements kenya is in great need of deploying lo w carbon climate resilient technologies and looks forward to the continued support of the tm in satisfying this need for the implementation of its plans and strategies for its development and for the achievement of the objectives of the convention and the paris agreement predictable financial support to the ctcn is a concern that kenya would like to be promptly addressed regarding the alignment between processes pertaining to the review of the climate technology centre and network and the periodic assessm ent kenya appreciates the importance of the processes in enhancing the effectiveness of the technology mechanism for its continued operation for the benefit of developing countries the alignment process should ensure retention of the value it adds to the effectiveness of the technology mechanism in carrying out its mandates in the implementation of the convention and the paris agreement and in ensuring timeliness and harmony with other critical events of the convention and agreement regarding the poznan strategic programme on technology transfer kenya appreciates specific guidance so far provided to the ctcn in its collaboration with the african development bank and the global environment facility to establish a useful way forward with respect to the af rica regional energy centres based on the lessons learned and calls for elaborate engagement on the same concerning the linkages between the technology mechanism and the financial mechanism of the convention kenya maintains that this agenda item be ret ained given that the positive results of the linkages are now being realised as a result of guidance previously provided hence the need to continue providing guidance for attainment of optimal levels of output 12 on matters relating to capacity  building re garding capacity  building under the convention kenya takes note of the fourth review and welcome the initiation of the fifth review of the framework for capacity  building in countries with economies in transition kenya urges the sbi continue to monitor a nd report on the implementation of the framework for capacity  building in developing and sbi deliberation of the key findings in thee durban forum on capacity  building and the meetings of the pccb pccb should then enhance coher ence and coordination of capacity  building efforts and ensure that identified capacity gaps and needs both current and emerging and recommendations are addressed in a timely manner on capacity  building under the kyoto protocol kenya welcomes the initia tion of the fourth framework for capacity  building in developing countries and the fifth review of the framework for capacity  building in countries with economies in transition kenya urges continual support to developing countries on capacity building on current and emerging areas especially matters relating to article 6 and 13 of the paris agreement on matters related to action for climate empowerment regarding the review of the doha work programme on article 6 of the convention kenya take s note of the suggested elements for the review doha work programme and in particular the continuation of annual in  session ace dialogues organization of youth forum  development  implementation of ace strategies kenya supports a robust and balanced implementation of the 6 priority areas education training public awareness public access to information public participation and international cooperation it is our view that the operating entities of the financial mechanism and other development financial instit utions to dedicate specific funding for ace activities there is need for s trengthening the network of ace national focal points to exchange views including via a platform or regular meetings 13 regarding report on activities related to action for climate e mpowerment kenya takes note of the 8th ace dialogue and encourages the youth under youngo  ace focal persons to continue with their meetings and events kenya notes that the ace forum has multiple benefits including being a driver of climate action and a tool for achieving climate targets a hub for multilevel multi  stakeholder collaboration and a source of innovation and new ideas for climate action 14 a great opportunity  not just to richly excha nge of views  but to m ak e bold decisions that will spur accelerated climate action and enable us achieve the goals of the paris agreement thank you all  ', 'check against

secretary general of the united nations mr chairman at the outset i wish to thank the government of the united kingdom and the government of italy for convening this conference amid the current global epidemiological situation kyrgyzst an like the rest of the world is looking forward to the outcomes people have begun to suffer from the negative impacts of climate change in this regard let me reassure you that kyrg yzstan is committed to the spirit and goals of the paris agreement in spite of the difficulties in its implementation we remain very optimistic kyrgyzstan will continue participating responsibly and fully in the global campaign to slow down climate c hange by implementing the nationally determined contribution until 2030 dear heads of delegations by 2030 kyrgyzstan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by forty  four percent 44 currently our countrys share in the global emission is negligib le about zero point zero three percent 003 activity we estimate that the implementation of the necessary medium  term mitigation actions to cost 7 billion us dollars by 2050 kyrgyzstan aims to reach carbon  neutrality on the basis of green development renewable energy especially hydropower will be the driver of the carbon  free economic development we intend to develop small and medium hydropower projects with a view of shifting industry housing and utilities infrastructure to electricity consumption at the expense of the carbon  based energy sources primarily coal and heating oil without any negative impact on the environment presently ten small and medium hydropowerplants are being constructed some of them have already been operational the rest will be ready by the end of the next year in acc ordance with the paris agreement spirit i invite private investors from developed economies to cooperate with us in the hydropower sector also using public  private partnership schemes without advanced technology innovation and know  how transfer timel y and simultaneous achievement of green economic growth and carbon neutrality in kyrgyzstan will be difficult in this regard i call on all stakeholders especially international multilateral banks climate funds and corporations to have serious discussion with us dear ladies and gentlemen it is vital for kyrgyzstan not only to preserve its ancient glaciers water resources and celestial mountains from climate change but also protect from abusive economic activities that unfortunately are the case in our country in this regard i urge the international community to work together against such unacceptable bus iness practices in areas of adaptation we are carrying out programs and projects in vulnerable sectors such as agriculture water resources energy industry disaster risk mitigation public health forests and biodiversity given that ninety  four per cent 94 of our territory is mountainous the scope of work to be done is immense we estimate adaptation measures to cost nearly 3 billion us dollars dear summit participants the described problems from the negative effects of climate change are in many ways common for mountainous countries their governments including that of kyrgyzstan may need donor assistance to address them in this regard we propose to foresee and i nclude in the glasgow outcome decisions the targeted funding arrangements for developing mountainous countries in need of assistance we propose under the auspices of the un to establish a special fund to implement needs tailored adaptation programs with focus on the conservation of glaciers forests and biodiversity enhancing disaster risk preparedness and socio  economic support to mountainous communities especially women and children in my opinion the era of long and pretty speeches is over it is time to act purposefully consistently and effectively in conclusion i wish to stress that we can only solve our problems by working together thank you for your attention ', ' 1

of the united kingdom  in partnership with italy  for their great effort to host this meaningful c onference despite challenges caused by the on  going covid  19 pandemic  mr president the lao p dr has attached great importance to combating climate change  we are committed to implement the paris agreement by incorporating its relevant provisions into our national socio  economic development plan a nd national green growth strategy while promoting international cooperation and engagement of relevant stakeholders  early this year the lao government has revised our n ationally determined contribution n dc  that clearly outlines ambitious targets of the national actions for tackling and mitigating climate change toward achieving net  zero emissions by 2050 we have also set out lofty goals to achieve by 2030 which include  among others reduc ing the greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent increasing forest cover to 70 of total land area promoting increased use of renewable and clean energy through a 30 share of electric vehicles 10 biof uel and improv ing water management practices i n order to translate our ndc into reality there is a pressing need for adequate financial resources  including enhanced f inancial and technical support and assistance from the international community especially develop ment partners it is our firm belief that gaining access to climate finance and other sources of funding is crucial to support ing developing countries especially ldcs  lldcs and sids to achieve the ir developme nt goals and commitments made under the paris agreement mr president having recognized the paramount importance of p romoting clean and renewable energy and the role of forest cover as a pathway to decouple greenhouse gas emissions  the government of lao pdr has further initiated several measures and policies including the recent announcement of policy on the use of electric vehicles  the allocation of 165 million hectares as forestland to increase forest cover as well as the plan to develop a 600  megawatt wind power plant which is the first cross  border electricity interchange from wind power generation in the region in addition we have implemented the safe clean climate resilient hospital initiative to further promote low carbon environmentally sustainable technology as well as green procurement and supply this is the first significant step by the health sector to begin developing plan for implementing low  carbon resilient health care  mr president  3 let me conclude by reiterating firm commitment to undertake urgently our common task of combat ing climate change through vigorously implementing the paris agreement in collaboration with all stakeholders and by call for strong political will coupled with concrete actions taken by all parties to curb the rise in global greenhouse gas emission s and limit global warming to 15 degree celsius as set out in the paris agreement  last but not least i would like to

renewables m ore than half of our land is covered by forest o ur greenhouse gas emissions per capita have decreased by more than a third since 1990  yet i often meet resistance to pro  active steps that would decrease our reliance on fossil fuels there is still much to be done especially in the fields of energy transport and agriculture while we work towards limiting climate change a daptation is also essential  n ecessary changes may create social challenges  certain individuals groups and nations will in the short and medium term suffer loss es  the concerns of those who m istrust and refuse to accept the climate agenda must be answered  i n order to promote reform it is necessary to create mechanisms which would at least partially off  set their losses   crucially such mechanisms need to be backed by adequate resources greater interaction between science and business is also urgently needed scaling up of investments in green technologies is key to sustainable growth  synergies between different financial instruments public support mechanisms and private resources need to be strengthened a robust framework of rules to ensure environmental integrity of the system and promote

disruptiveconsequences of the deadly coronavirus pandemic climatechange like covid19 presents an even bigger threat to theworld and to our common humanity we have therefore gathered here at this 26th united nationsclimate change conference to seek common action to save ourplanet and bring equity and fairness to how we achieve theseobjectives under the paris accord on climate change 2upon taking the leadership of my country in 2018 one of the firstmajor steps that i took was to ensure the ratification of the parisagreement in that same year  this was a demonstration of mygovernment™s highest political commitment to ensure that liberiais among the comity of nations working together in addressing thechallenges of climate changein june of this year i convened a national climate change andenvironment conference to mobilize my citizens and partners inworking together to urgently address the critical issue of climatechange and environment liberia™s revised nationallydetermined contributions were presented and adopted at thatconference and have subsequently been submitted to the unclimate change secretariat  your excellencies we welcome the us government back to theparis

countries3liberia therefore looks forward to joining  and leading in the  usgovernment™s conserve global forest  carbon sink programand to joining similar programs launched by other advancednations  with the largest forest cover of more than 43 in the equatorialguinea rainforest liberia serves as a major hub for carbonsequestration this natural endowment is a buffer not only for usbut the larger world we are a major part of the global lungs whichmake it possible for the industrial world to breath it is our intention to maintain these forests in prime condition andthat is why we have outlined in our revised nationallydetermined contributions specific climateresilient andadaptation measures that we are determined to implement inorder to guarantee the wellness of these global lungs4since signing the paris accord liberia has lived up to its promiseto reduce deforestation from logging and timber production andfrom agriculture we have expanded our protected forests andwe are prepared to protect more forests and to intensify our workwith local communities to expand their options for food and fuel inorder to reduce pressure on forest resources however is this high level of forest conservation paying off forliberia excellencies distinguished ladies and gentlemenwe are all aware that there is an inherent imbalance in the currentarchitecture of climate financing countries like liberia whomaintain and protect the largest remaining tracts of forestreserves receive the lowest benefits for these ecosystemservices  we who are the richest in terms of forest resources andbiodiversity are the poorest in terms of socioeconomicdevelopment  5although we bear the brunt of the impact of climate change webenefit the least from the existing solutions and financialarrangements currently in place for tackling climate changein order to address this imbalance there needs to be afundamental shift in the way we tackle this mismatch in climateinvestments todayi believe that one of the ways that this can be done is to establishan african carbon credit trading mechanism  with yoursupport liberia will be willing to host a conference in the nearfuture to explore the details and structure of such an entity  wewill work with panafrican and other global financial institutions todevelop a longterm regulated market for african carbon crediti am convinced that these initiatives will increase the chances forall african countries that depend on their forest reserves to attainsustainable economic growth and national development in linewith the vision set out in the 2030 agenda6 excellencies accessing climate finance is key for liberia in orderto achieve our revised climate change ambitions even as werecognize the roles of the various climate financing mechanismssuch as the green climate fund global environment facilityadaptation fund and many others we must acknowledge thatthere is a huge gap in climate investments today we thereforeneed to reimagine what a successful future looks like in climatefinancing  and this will require fundamental shifts in the way wethink therefore even as we intensify our ecosystem protection we aredetermined to join other forested countries in africa to expandresources available to us for achieving the sustainabledevelopment goals here at cop 26 we must find a strategic balance betweenmitigation and adaptation on the one hand and commitment toclimate financing on the other hand developed countries musttranslate the principle of leaving no one behind into actionthrough the mobilization and scaling up of capital flows for energydevelopment and energy transition for the african continent7we as global leaders must collectively adopt a new mindset ofappropriate and urgent action in the fight against climate changethat will fully address the three goals of the paris agreementmitigation adaptation and finance for a netzero carbon emissionby 2050 together we can make a difference as a shared community ofglobal citizens with a common destiny together we can heal theworld from the scourges of climate change together we cansave this earth from the deadly consequences of global warming

and gentlemen let me start by expressing my gratitude to the government of the united king dom for their huge efforts to welcome all of us in glasgow and to assure the continuity of international climate diplomacy at times of a global pandemic  the fact that so many of us are present at the highest possible political level is a proof of the importance and urgency of the topic i truly hope that today and in the coming two weeks we will not only speak about climate change we must move forward increase ambition and turn our collective and individual com mitments into true action we need a concrete and positive outcome of the cop26 and liechtenstein will support the presidency as much as possible to succeed our meeting today is much more than just a conference about climate change it is a conference about the future of our planet the future of our states and the future of humankind it is our moral duty to ensure a liveable planet and a healthy environment for future generations a dialogue with the youth is es sential we must also listen to science and the ipcc in particular what does science tell us global warming is not simply a raise in temperatures that leads to more extreme weather conditions and deterio rates biodiversity  if we do not succeed to limit global warming below 15 °c we will be unable to ensure food security water and sanitation in many regions of the world inundation due to sea level rise threatens the ability of small island states to express their peo 3  ples™ right to self determination through statehood  new conflicts about re sources and forced migration will emerge if we do not succeed in our individ ual and collective efforts in short climate change is a global security threat that calls for collective multilateral action the 2030 agenda for sustainable development must therefore guide all our decisions    the time for decisive global action is now and liechtenstein urges all states to take up their global responsibility  every state can and must contribute to tackle climate change and so does liechtenstein we recogni se the urgent need to protect biodiversity and improve adaptation measures and to take early ac tion to reduce vulnerability to the massive effects of climate change liechten stein therefore support s the glasgow leader™s declaration on forests and land use some of us have argued that reducing greenhouse gas emissions while achiev ing economic and social well being is incompatible liechtenstein can serve as an example to prove the opposite since 1990 our population has grown by one third and our gdp has more than quadrupled  nevertheless  liechtenstein will achieve the kyoto target 2020 and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to levels well below those of 1990 greenhouse gas emissions per capita are amongst the lowest in europe  despite the fact that liechtenstein is one of the most industrialised countries in the world it is therefore possible to decouple economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions to make this happen  con sistent investment in innovative technologies to boost renewable energies and to increase energy efficiency is essential  for instance liechtenstein has been solar world champion since 2015 with the highest installed photovoltaic capac ity per capita 4  however we need to go beyond these achievements we are committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 in october 2020 the liechtenstein gov ernment has adopted the climate vision 2050 the energy strategy 2030 and the energy vision 2050 the goal of net zero emissions has also been intro duced in to our national legislation  i am personally committed to promote the implementation of these goals in the spirit of the 2030 agenda œ which embeds climate change in sdg 13 œ we are fully aware that we should not limit our action to reduce emissions domes tically many of the goods we import and consume are produced abroad also our financial sector inve sts globally and has an influence on emissions in other countries sustainable finance and production are therefore crucial many pri vate companies in liechtenstein from the industrial and financial sector have published ambitious commitments with regard to sustainability  such private commitments towards sustainable transformation of the global economy are crucial and i encourage more private actors to follow this path  the liechtenstein government support s developing countries in their effort to improve mitigation action s and adaptation to climate chang e and dedicate around ten percent of our annual budget for international humanitarian coop eration and development to climate finance  supporting the green climate fund is a key element of our financial engagement per capita we contribute with usd 70 to climate finance annually and the government is committed to further increase climate finance from next year with a focus on the humanitar ian sector i personally welcome the climate and energ y charter of the icrc liechtenstein will support the efforts of the humanitarian sector to become more climate and environment friendly 5  in the course of our more than three hundred years of sovereignty liechten stein has developed from an agrarian into a highly industrialised economy only farsighted thinking and clear dedication to multilateral cooperation allowed us to overcome and continuously prosper amidst many challenges in that sense i urge all states according to our common but differentiated responsibility to collectively and individually increase our ambitions and follow

warm greetings  from the republic of the marshall islands i am speaking to you as a representative of a country under siege from the onslaught of climate change it is already upon us today it threatens to overtake us in the near future the storm of the climate catastrophe is gathering destructive power with every failed promise and missed target  if there were ever a moment for bold and committed leadership  it is now and here in glasgow mr president we cannot delay adapting to the changing climate any longer  no country will avoid its effects and many countries will suffer irreparable damage we must not only stay within the 15 degrees celsius limit in order to survive but prepare to survive the impacts asso ciated with this increase some of us must act with a greater urgency and consider more extreme measures than others as a low  lying atoll nation we know that physical responses like reclaiming land and building seawalls will take the cost of adaptation into the billions of dollars  and will likely still not be enough to protect our country  if king tide storms and extreme weather events contin ue to ravage our shores sea level continues to rise and as oceans continue to warm and become more acidic bleaching and destroying our coral that represents our nations very foundation we will be left with limited options as atoll nations the fail ure of others to do what is necessary to tackle climate change forces us to grapple with extreme and existential challenges we will never accept that anthropogenic climate change  which we did not cause be the basis for a loss of our sovereignty our s overeign rights or our maritime boundaries we will preserve our nation and our culture against any and all 2 challenges that we face the marshall islands need the support of developed countries in this critical undertaking particularly those that have co ntributed the most to this crisis therefore  we must use cop26 to generate real change in how we address adaptation we must provide the scientific and financial focus it demands  the marshall islands therefore call on all donor nations and multilatera l development partners to address the extremely wide gap that currently exists between mitigation and adaptation funding and to ultimately achieve a fifty  fifty split between them as a first step a commitment to at least doubling of adaptation financing from current levels is essential and we must form a strong foundation to ignite a step  change on adaptation movement further developing the science on adaptation and establishing an accurate understanding of the resources required to address it the i pcc special report on 15 gave us a firm basis for the target agreed in paris and a similar analysis on adaptation is needed the science is clear that this is the critical decade for keeping 15 in check we must cut emissions in half by 2030 to make this possible and to stay on track we must all re  commit to this target and take urgent action to deliver it g20 leaders your countries make up 80 of global emissions the world is watching and we the vulnerable nations of this world urgently call you to take action reflecting ambition in enhanced ndcs and long  term strategies that align with a 15 pathway all nations must demonstrate their ambition for this by urgently updating their ndcs to ensure alignment to this 15 survival figure   in paris we agreed that countries would be welcomed to submit ndcs at any time again if there is ever a time in which we must act upo n this opportunity to increase ambition to demonstrate this commitment it is now we must come back to the table at cop27 with 15 aligned ndcs and keep coming back to the table until we are on a track cop26 here in glasgow has the power to accelerat e an unprecedented shift in the global economy to a post  carbon and green future it is already underway though far too slowly we must put an end to the worst offenders coal and super  pollutants must go  we must put an end to fossil fuel subsidies we should not pay for our own destruction nonetheless during this of the world on the path for collective fight against climate change critical transport sec tors like aviation and shipping keep the global economy moving however left unchecked will also spell global destruction we must reach zero emissions by 2050 in maritime shipping and implement a carbon levy to meet that target in a way that not only ca talyzes 3 innovation but also provides crucial resources for the vulnerable we welcome new opportunities that support sustainable ocean  based economies and large scale marine protected areas mr president we will not see a safe and secure future that le aves no one behind without resources the delivery of the 100 billion is vital and as we initiate discussions on a post  2025 finance goal we must ensure that we base these discussions on an accurate assessment of needs and  as always at the heart of our work  the science the paris agreement rulebook must be completed in a way that puts ambition and environmental integrity at its core  article 6 is a critical tool for driving de  carbonization and has the potential to provide a predictable funding stream for adaptation but the wrong system will set us further back than we can afford mr president we urge fellow parties to honor and respect their obligations to futur e generations  to commit to the kwon gesh climate pledge and to involve you th in the self determined decisions that will shape their future the climate crisis will affect us all but some remain excluded from these discussions the in at cop25 in madrid we committed to using our newly  secured seat at the human rights council to advance climate justice and we are proud to play a role in instituting a special rapporteur on climate change at the human rights council established at the most recent session mr president we convene the high ambition coalition and stand ready to support progress at this cop it is clear that ambition this year is n ot limited to one element of the paris agreement but rather on a package of outcomes on mitigation adaptation and finance the

displacement of people especially from low lying islands page 3 of 5 concrete action accompanied by adequate and predictable funding is  therefore  absolutely essential we all have a responsibility to address thi s challenge and mauritius is prepared to do its share we  therefore  commit to take actions that will contribute towards the following  1 reducing gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 2 achieving 60 per cent of green energy in our energy mix by 20 3 0 3 pha sing out coal in electricity generation before 2030 4 promoting a circular economy involving 70 per cent of waste from landfills

stakeholders including p rivate sector indigenous people  disadvantaged communities women and youth in all our climate actions  recognizing the value of nature to both adapt and mitigate climate change  we have decided to create a dedicated institution for working on nature cons ervation and climate change together  mr president loss and damage has become a key concern due to increased phenomena of climate induced disasters this subject must find a place under article 48 of the convention we call upon the parties to agree on making loss and damage a stand  alone agenda for negotiations and support the framework of additional financing for it the cop 26 must ensure adequate support for adaptation in the most vulnerable counties by scaling up financial technological and capacity  building resources  we can deliver on our goals only through quick direct and easy access to climate finance we urge the parties to agree on a clear roadmap for a new colle ctive quantified and ambitious goal on climate finance before 2025 in closing mr president the decisions we make at cop 26 must do justice to those affected now the future generations and the mother nature the future

threatened by flooding caused by extreme rainfall it was a terrifying sight  th ere  the dikes held but elsewhere in the province and across the border in belgium and germany  raging torrents caused devastation  more and more people worldwide are being impacted by climate change serious  and it calls for serious action first we need further binding global commitments and concrete measures to keep global warming below 15 degrees for example reducing harm ful emissions to net zero delivering a sustainable energy transition that offers new opportunities and investin g in a circular economy cop26 can and must make real progress on these points  2 but we have to face reality climate change is already ha ving lasting effects so c limate resilience must be our motto climate adaptation our common endeavour the kingdom of the netherlands has been battling the elements for centuries from north sea floods to caribbean storms  adaptation is in our dna but due n unprecedented challenge  working hard to address it  both at home and at internationa l level  for example by hosting the climate adaptation summit earlier this year and as co  host of the un 2023 water decade conference adaptation is the right thing to do the smart thing to do studies show that invest ing in adaptation and resilience works  because c limate  proofing cities farming and infrastructure protects livelihoods and ensures economic continuity and i nnovative nature  based solutions and sustainable business models create new jobs and economic opportunities climate adaptation pays off in so many ways but for the most vulnerable communities adaptation funds are often in short supply  more than half public climate financing goes to adaptation we hope that more countries will follow suit 3 because climate mitigation and adaptation are two sides of the same coin r and w ith that principle as our guide we have to take action timely firm and concerted action ladies and gentlemen you can count on the

cop 26 distinguished ladies and gentlemen mr president let me take this opportunity to thank the government and people of united kingdom for successfully hosting th e conference in the beautiful city of glasgow  the ongoing covid crisis has taught us two very important lessons firstly that we can not fight nature and hope to win the covid pandemic biodiversity crisis and the climate calamity are all manifestations of a losing battle 2 nature knows how to rebalance and it will it is us who need to step back from this warpath secondly the covid crisis has shown us that a better world is out there and possible  this is the world that the youth out on the streets is crying out for this is the future that all of us in here need to be fighting for it is a decarbonized and a nature positive world excellency under the visionary green leadership of our pm i mran kha n  pakistan has taken the choice to embrace this new world shifting to clean energy and making nature an ally rather than an adversary of development  our climate vision is built on these two pillars  shifting 60 of our energy mix towards clean energy by 2030 and 30 of our transport on ev by 2030 and of putting our trust and investment we have announced to completely shift out of imported coal projects and are turning the cpec into a china 3 pakistan gree n economic corridor three financially closed coal projects of 2500 mw have been shelved in the last year and shifted to zero carbon hydro power of 3700 mw has now become a global brand for success ful ecosystem rest oration through natural regeneration and forest plantations  all sequestering carbon for the world  the protected areas initiative in pakistan  with 15 new nps announced during the covid time is rapidly expanding and protecting our wilderness areas ou r is turning the crisis of floods into an opportunity by using it to restore our wetlands and recharge our ground water aquifers all these are examples of real climate action today not an illusion of climate action  and are now part of our updated ndc which remains one of the most ambitious jumps for climate action in the world 4 we have dropped our emissions 9 below bau in 2020 and have developed a pathway to reach 15 below bau by 2030 utilizing our own resources i repeat our own resources  however we have also thrown a conditional challenge to th e world  de liver us the climate finance of a  100 bn over the next decade and we will drop our emissions to 50 below bau with less than 1 of the global emissions pakistan is certainly not a part of the problem of climate change however we have chosen to be a part of the solution our ndc shows what is possible if a clear climate vision and strategic planning get positive ly aligned the world bank recently affirmed that 44 of our mainstream development finance is on a climate friendly pathway and it is the highest for any country in the world we are not just talking  but walking the talk on climate change can this r oom also walk the talk on climate finance currently overpromised and under delivered the decade old promissory note of a 100 billion needs to be delivered and more importantly 60 of it directed towards climate adaptation 5 excellency even though we are not a major contributor we continue to be on t he top ten list of most vulnerable countries for 10 straight years now this puts u ontinuously impacted the front lines  braving disastrous floods unlivable heatwaves and bursting glaciers this climate injustice is the gravest human rights violation of history where the lives and livelihoods of billions of people are at risk all due to the unbridled pollution and uncontrolled excesses of a few the forced climate adaptation needs remain at between 7 to 14 billion per annum and almost 70  of these fall in the loss and damage category  this adaptation finance is forced upon us today and presents a simple choice  between life and death  mr president the galaxy of world leaders who gathered here last week unfortunately failed to live up to the expectations of the world and rise to the reality of the grave challenge we face 6 climate change can not be wished away by throwing pennies into the trevi fountain nor by announc ing net zero scams pushing into 2070  climat e change is about action today and can no longer afford futuristic ious  this has to be the decisive decade for de  carb oniz ation and nature positive development  the silver linings of this process are not found in this room but on the sidelines the pavilion zone  where t he private sector initiatives are gaining ground the technologies becoming available and affordable and some new innovative financial mechanisms like pushing new frontiers  pakistan is actively engaged with al l this out of the box thinking and this is really what gives hope that a new world is possible ladies and gentlemen  it is now time 7 it is time to stop playing jokes with climate change we will most certainly not have the last laugh on this it is time to change course so let us make that happen here at glasgow let us not become the dinosaurs who refused to change i thank you  ', 'statement by his excellency surangel s

also thank the government of chile as the outgoing president for their invaluable contributions mr president we meet at a very critical period where climate change continues unabated causing the atmosphere oceans and the land to warm up at a faster rate than ever before this is detrimental to the environmental equilibrium of the global community particularly for those of us from small island states 2 papua new guinea is not immune from the adverse impacts of cli mate change rising sea levels and extreme erratic weather patterns that have devastated the livelihoods of the people and ecosystems that sustain their lives the lower  income and marginalized populations have been worst hit in their weak capacity to ad apt has been telling this has now been further compounded by the onset of the covid  19 pandemic which has laid bare the structural weaknesses inherent in these populations calli ng for a ramp up and an acceleration of ambitions to  century and keep 15 degrees within reach mr president in this context i reiterate my strong position at the recently concluded 76th united nations general assembly session an impassioned plea for major carbon emitters to own up and acknowledge the impact of high carbon emissions to small island s tates including victims of climate change we must take actions commensurate to the volume of emissions leaders of big carbon emitting nations must now lead the global effort in rebalancing the environmental equilibrium we live in one planet one atmospheric envelope and one interlinked environmental system hence as one humanity we must rise and unite to preserve our planet we must commit to the energy targets deal with land use and advocate for the preservation for biodiversity and be bold in financing commitments these issues are important to papua new guinea and the pacific island forum members hence we seek support for our domestic and regional efforts towards mitigation and adaptation i want to specifically request the green climate fund gcf to consider developing a special set of criteria to enable us to qualify and successfully draw  down financial support the level of funding that many small island states receive from gcf is still insignificant therefore i will meet the executi ve director of gcf separately on the margins of cop26 to discuss and progress this matter 3 mr president there is great need for all of us to act promptly responsibly and collectively to redefine our policies and actions to ensure that we live in a safe secure and resilient environment there is a need to make a call for all of us to ramp up on our commitments to support taking drastic and specific actions there is a call to ensure that our national commitments are clearly announced and that import ant timelines are clarified and locked in mr president we must move forward to conclude key elements of the paris rulebook and give due consideration for the conservation of our global rainforest and oceans in our view the rule book must not be c omplex and difficult but user  friendly to easily access support needed to deliver mitigation and adaptation actions nationally and globally mr president to complement global efforts and operationalize the paris rule book i am pleased to inform that papua new guinea has embarked on various initiatives including submission of our enhanced nationally determined contributions endc to the unfccc secretariat in 2020 outlining our goal to be carbon neutral by 2050 recently we launched the ndc implemen tation plan 2021  2030 the ndc regulation and the roadmap that captures the detailed information of commitment to proactively combat climate change domestically in addition my government ha s passed amendments to the climate change management act to guide and strengthen our domestic climate change actions in forestry we have ceased issuance of new timber permits and will ban export of round logs by 2025 this will be in tandem with the recently launched ndc roadmap for the agriculture forestry and other land use afolu and energy sectors aimed at achieving the pathway to achieve zero  net emissions target by 2050 to strengthen our commitment to forest conservation and management papu a new guinea and the international council for research in 4 agroforestry icraf will formalize a host agreement to develop agroforestry domestically on the margins of this meeting more importantly in our ongoing resolve to promote alternative clean ener gy sources i am pleased to inform that i will be signing a master development agreement with dr andrew forrest of

the consequences of climate change our country is sinki ng at a rate four times faster than the global average annually we are confronted with increasingly severe typhoons floods and droughts millions of lives are at stake clearly climate change is very real to the philippines to challenge ourselves an d the rest of the world we set the boldest national goal put philippines commits to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent in 2030 we are moving ahead with urgency to fulfill our ambitious target we shifted from theorizing about climate change to executing practical climate adaptation and mitigation projects on the ground we have put together a group of filipino experts who represent all corners of the philippines to engage our fishermen and farmers and prepare them to execute localized action plans we just launched our sustainable finance roadmap to deploy the engines of finance to get green projects moving across our archipelago to urge the filipino people to law banning single  use plastics we launched a partnership with the asian development bank for a landmark project that will accelerate our transition from coal to clean energy this comes after president duterte declared a moratorium on new coal plants a year ago these are concrete actions to demonstrate to the world how a developing and climate  vulnerable country like the philippines can lead in this fight to save our planet this also shows that our commitments are not merely empty or half  baked promises but are supported by actionable projects on the ground final we have very high expectations for this cop 26 to become not just merely an annual platform for discussion but a catalyst for concrete action plans climate justice those who have polluted and continue to pollute the earths environment through unthinking industrialization starting 200 years ago must pay for the grants investments and subsidies needed for the most vulnerable countries to adapt to climate change the

start by thanking the government of the united kingdom for the organization of th e cop26 and for all the work done in the difficult circumstances we have all been facing since our last cop in madrid there is only one acceptable outcome for cop26 one that commits all parties to a higher level of climate action and ambition  onethat delivers the complete rulebook for the full implementation of the paris agreement  science needs to be heard and integra ted into planning and decision  making processes at national regional and local level 2 and for that  national determined contributions ndc and long term strategies lts should reflect the urgency of delivering the 15ºc goal including through ambitious short term action and through net  zero commitments by mid  century portugal was the first country in the world to commit to climate neutrality by 2050 t h e european union did so when it made the goal to be climate neutral by 2050 and achieve negative emissions thereafter  through its climate law  which approved in the portuguese presidency of the council of the european union leadership lies with those who have phased  out coal who put a price on carbon who declined invest m e nts in fossil fuels  who invested in renewable energy  and in creating climate resilient biodiverse territor ies  with the capacity to enhance carbon sinks  through natural  based solutions from this month onwards portugal will end coal power generation  i n 2020  we reduce our emissions by 32  in relation to 2005 and more than 60 of our power generation was based on renewables  w e will continue t o invest in renewables especially in solar energy t hese investments are now being complemented with projects based on green hydrogen 3 i n paris we were looking at commitments that would put us collectively at 31°c  recent reports were pointing still to 27°c this is not enough and not fast enough the most recent ipcc report clearly shows that we all must be aware that t he longer we delay cli mate action the more intense its effects will be and the greater the costs of inaction ladies and gentlemen finalising the katowice rulebook is key to ensure the paris agreements full operative and move forward  i hope that consensus can be reached on common time frame s of 5  years for the ndcs of all parties since it´s the most effective way to synchronize the national commitments of the parties with the paris cycle of ambition  on article 6 we need a result that allows actions  including voluntary carbon market actions that ensure integrity and environmental ambition and are consistent with the necessary increase in global ambition 4 it is crucial to complete the framework for enhanced transparency  ensur ing that all parties can report on progress in a comparable quantified and transparent manner climate finance is key and our priority should be to focus on delivering the current goal we need to continue work on broadening the donor base mobilising the p rivate sector and to achieve a better balance between mitigation and adaptation in line with the priorities of the receiving countries portugal is committed to continue financ ing climate action  in particular through the portuguese environmental fund  in partner countries such as portuguese speaking african countries  as a sign of our commitment we pledge to double climate finance  allocating a total of 35 million euros by 2030 cop 26 must deliver a strong message on carbon pricing  on phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies  and the relevance of aligning public and private financial flows with

of interconnected measures can help us deliver we will harness the very force of nature romania has a solid share of renewable energy in its energy mix with 40 of our electricity coming from renewable sources we are committed to expand this share we will fight climate change with nature  based solut ions using 57000 hectares of new forests in our recovery plan to capture carbon and combat desertification we also need to channel the force of people in addressing climate change education is key to environmentally friendly behaviour we must advance education and research on climate change starting in 2023 romania will host an innovative world meteorological organization centre that will help agricultural systems in europe better respond to climate change the impact of climate change

and gentlemen addressing global warming and p revention of climate change depends on the ability of all nations to set aside differences and join together in resolving th e s e challenges  russia is mostly a northern country yet we are facing negative impacts of global warming including increase of desert areas soil erosion forest fires  floods and melting of permafrost we take these matters seriously and responsibly as you might be well aware the president of t he russian federation vladimir putin has announced that russia will reach carbon neutrality by 2060 this promise is based on a comprehensive approach covering not only the problems of controlling and decreasing emission but also managing and improving gre enhouse gas absorbing capabilities of our natural ecosystems including forests tundra farmland marshes and seas taking a promise of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 does not mean that russia is refraining from achieving this goal 3 earlier the succes s depends on availability of new technologies and funds to finance this transition through history human ingenuity has always led to finding solutions to the most complex issues  we are confident that this time humanity will also develop solutions that will bring a better future c limate change requires all countries to work together and share knowledge and tools therefore there should be no discrimination or restrictions preventing countries from accessing and using technologies and financing tools that will facilitate development of new sustainable infrastructure capture and storage decarbonization improvement of energy efficiency  and support transition to clean energy and if someone will be hampering this all of us would know w ho should be blamed for failing to reach climate goals i nternational efforts are also critical for enhancing cooperation in areas of ecosystem management developing and improving monitoring and reporting emission and absorption practices a s well as measuring progress in meeting climate goals it is 4 critical to develop common fair and transparent rules for carbon pricing measurement and ensure their multilateral recognition and comparability between countries in october 2021 the russian governme nt has adopted a new 2050 strategy of social and economic development with low greenhouse gas emission this strategy outlines measures that by 2050 compared to 1990 will bring our country to an 80 net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions while maxim izing absorbing capacity of our forests and other ecosystems it also outline s low greenhouse gas emission development measures until 2050 to achieve these ambitio u s objectives we are focusing on improvin g our forest management practices enhancing wildland fire prevention and response capabilities preserving and increasing wilderness areas  introducing new farming practices as well as engaging in transformation towards clean er energy our energy companie s are implementing low emission technologies to ensure production delivery and distribution of cleaner fuel to consumers our region s started pilot projects that 5 will help finding solutions to these problems we welcome participation of international comm unity in these p rojects  new renewable energy sources are increasing their share in energy balances of countries throughout the world with 86 of our energy generation coming from solar wind natural gas nuclear and example of one of the lowest carbon emissions per unit  we intend to maintain this leadership by introducing blue and green hydrogen and promoting the use this new fuel through the economy at the same ti me our government strategy is pursuing the goal of finding and maintaining a balance between policies aimed at addressing climate challenges and reaching sustainable development goals to continu e economic growth and improvement of living standard of our pe ople building a safer environment implies significant investments and changes that will affect economies  create new markets redirect resources and alter supply chains as well as l i ves of the people it is our deep belie f that addressing global warming and 6 climate change should not lead to further increase of poverty  not just in the developing but in the developed world as well  transition to new economy should be based on an equilibrium where investment returns and long  term asset value increase w ill be balanced by reliable energy supply that meets growing energy demand a s well as the goals of reduction and absorption of greenhouse gas emissions the solution of this equilibrium will determine the living standard of our descendants this is a new economic balance that all of us will need to find together and while this will be happening at the time of th e s e enormous changes  russia will remain a reliable supplier of energy to international markets and consumers hope i did not take too much of your time thank you very much ', 'republic of

point  this is the last decad e 2020  2030  the last chance to set the world on track to 15 degrees the question is will we rise to the chall enge will our moral conscience prevail small island developing states as my country saint lucia whose special circumstances and needs were settled in paris  are in the midst of crisis for humanity the un secretary general described the ipcc w orking group 1 r eport as  undeniably certain changes such as sea level rise and ocean acidificaton are already locked in with dire consequences for sids and low lying states   but we know that 15 degrees celsius is still within our reach  to achiev e it we must act and act now countries must urgently bring forward new ndcs with 2030 targets consistent with the 15  degree temperature goal supported by credible net zero  by  2050 long  term strategies we must support wind solar and other renewable energy investments the power to turn things around lies in our collective hands we must be focused a nd resolute  we cannot vacillate on matters of human survival 2 in this regard world leaders must deliver on the long  term climate finance g oal that was promised supporting not only mitigation but a lso adaptation we must also raise the profile of and mainstream loss and damage as a distinct pillar of climate action and support  moreover it is high time that we complete the paris rulebook   when we bring to fru  i  tion that vital work we can strengthen accountability and enable the highest possible ambition while ensuring transparency and environmental integrity colleagues fr iends we in the developing world are on the front lines exposed our poor vulnerable citizens have limited ability to respond to climate change effects and so their quality of life is significantly diminished as

we continue to grapple with the challenges precipitated by the covid  19 pandemic  the devastation caused by the explosive e ruption of the la soufriere volcano and severe floods and landslides due to more extreme weather phenomena these challenges underscore our intrinsic vul nerabilities and threaten our very existence 4 mr president the most pertinent questions for our people are the following  how long will aspirational declarations and diplomatic maneuvering delay the concrete actions required to ensure our planet remains below the 15 degree target  will developed countries ackno wledge that in sufficient fund ing for adaptation measures results in catastrophic loss and damage to  sids  w ill g20 countries responsible for nearly 80 of carbon emissions honour their commitment to develop and implement ambitious ndcs to reduce global emissions 2 5 st vincent and the grenadines therefore calls for urgent action to avert this climate crisis 6 the unfccc synthesis report clearly indicates that current ndcs are woefully inadequate 7 they will not bridge the gap between existing commitments and the 15  pathway 8 we must accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in this decisive decade to achieve net zero by 205 0 9 failure to take the necessary steps to address this c limate crisis is reckless and endangers the 72 million people living in small island developing states 10 to compromise on the required targets and measures is a death sentence for our people  11 neg otiating your way out of this responsibility is not an option 12 mr president my country continues to do its part both nationally and internationally as a non  permanent m ember of the un security council in the global fight against climate change 13 howev er new and a dditional

finance pledges and we urge others to d eliver on the outstanding 100 b illion per annum commitment 15 this fight requires the inclusive action and meaningful participation of everyone we commend taiwan efforts to legislate climate targets and they should be at the table 16 finally mr president cop 26 must be remembered as the s ummit where we completed the paris rule book  anything less will

glasgow uk 1 2 november 2021 excellencies distinguished delegates ladies and gentlemen climate change has long been an interwoven fabric of life for the blue pacific including samo a over decades  as small island developing states sids  we first told the world that our coastlines were eroding the sea level was rising and climate change was human  induced many did not take our concerns seriously some wanted scientific evidence whi le others remained in denial  now the recent ipcc reports confirm all this and more as humanity there is no time for second guessing  w e need to act urgently and decisively with much higher climate ambition to correct our mistakes t hat led to the cur rent climate crises page 2 of 4 we acknowledge efforts by all parties that have committed to ambitious climate action  however it is concerning that there is still a wide emissions gap in meeting the 15°c goal  even with limiting warming to 15°c sids will continue to incur severe l oss and damage  exceeding this will be catastrophic for us hence the constant iteration by the blue pacific leaders  that climate change is the single greatest threat to our people and islands we recognize the double burden of addressing the parallel crises of climate change and the pandemic  but we stand to lose a lot more if we remain in a state of inaction the covid  19 pandemic should not delay ambitious climate action instead sustainable economic recovery should be catalyzed through investments that are clean climate  smart and in line with net zero emissions by 2050 the development of covid  19 vaccines was the fastest in history  its rollout around the world at large scale required a massive global coordinated effort  i often ponder on how we can push for this historical united urgent global response at the same massive scale to help us reach the 15 degrees celsius promise of the paris agreement for us as the blue pacific we need to inject some of that urgency and ambitious actions li ke what we achieved with the covid19 vaccinations to deliver the needed climate action it is in glasgow  that climate urgency enter s the collective consciousness  we must ensure through commitments and our decisions at cop26 that we keep the hope of a 15 degree world this is our point of no return page 3 of 4 but w e as sids  know that despite our best efforts the real impact to reverse the cycle of decline we are in relies on the will and commitment of oth ers for this reason we will persist to call on everyone especially the major emitters to commit to ambitiou s emissions cuts by 2030 implement commitments consistent with the 15°c scenario and net zero global emissions by 2050 n ature based solutions should take precedence in our su stainable development efforts phasing out of coal plants and all fossil fuel subsidies and investments are critical we continue to stress the importance of the delivery of the us 100 billion goal to ensuring th e implementation of ambitious mitigation commitments  however funding for the root causes of climate change is exponentially greater than funding for the response to climate change this must change we need to ensure a new scaled up climate finance go al that builds on the usd100 billion floor  we must guarantee a balanced allocation of climate finance between mitigation and adaptation climate finance made available to sids are still insufficient and are mainly in the form of loans   sids must receive scaled up adequate predictable and long  term support from the international community to adapt   loss and damage needs dedicated funding  cop 26 must address the long  term and permanent consequences of insufficient climate action w hile we urge f or cop 26 to conclude negotiation s on the paris rulebook it is important that it adopts a markets mechanism which delivers meaningful global emissions reductions  we must ensure that we continue to uphold the principle of environmental integrity and keep the paris agreement promise this is critical when finalising cop26 outcomes page 4 of 4 lastly but not the least th e ocean absorbs nearly a quarter of annual carbon dioxide the climate  ocean nexus is clear thus oceans needs to feature

and gentlemen the kingdom of saudi arabia believes that we all have to renew our efforts to implement the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and the paris agreement and that we all should keep in mind the principle of shared yet distinct responsibilities among different countries equally we should all be conscious of the special circumstances of the less developed countries and we should work together to help these countries mitigate the impact of climate change policies  without compromising their sustainable development in light of this the kingdom has recently launched the saudi green initiative sgi and the middle east green initiative mgi which aim to reduce carbon emissions in the middle east by more than 10 of the current global contributions over the past decade recognizing the increasing importance of prioritizing our climate change ambitions the kingdom has revised its nationally determined contribution ndc pledging to reduce emissions by 278 million tons per year by 2030 more than double the previous goal set in 2015 it has also announced its ambition to achieve net zero by 2060 within the circular carbon economy cce framework and in line with the kingdomõs developmental and diversification plans and the dynamic baseline of its ndc providing that the necessary technologies for this approach are mature and available this will help ensure that the kingdom maintains and enhances its leadership role in promoting the security and stability of energy markets furthermore the kingdom has announced its intention to join the global methane pledge which aims at limiting methane emissions by 30 compared with 2020 levels to realize these ambitious plans the details of more than 53 saudi initiatives have been published with more than 185 billion dollars of investment these initiatives include increasing the share of renewables in the power mix to 50 launching the saudi energy efficiency program establishing one of the largest hydrogen hubs in the world in neom as the kingdom aspires to produce 4 million tons of green and blue hydrogen annually and setting up the largest ccus complex with a capacity of 44 million tons per year by 2030 in addition the kingdom is establishing a 10 billion dollar fund for deploying cce technologies in the middle east africa and developing countries the kingdom has also launched a global initiative to provide clean cooking solutions to more than 750 million people the total investment in these two initiatives is around 11 billion dollars of which the kingdom will finance 15 saudi arabia will work with different countries and regional and international funds to seek ways to finance and implement these initiatives in addition the kingdom announced as well a number of regional and international initiatives such as a regional center for early warning of storms and a regional center for sustainable development of fisheries both will play a crucial role in building the infrastructure needed to protect the environment reduce emissions and promote regional coordination it has also launched one of the largest afforestation projects in the world for planting trees in the kingdom and the middle east to remove carbon ladies and gentlemen the fact that climate change is a universal phenomenon requires an international shared and effective response that response should address three main pillars energy security economic development for the benefit of humanity and climate change all of these pillars must be addressed in a holistic manner without compromising one for the sake of another it is imperative that we recognize the diversity of climate solutions and the importance of emissions reduction as stipulated in the paris agreement without any bias

for the opportunity to address our crisis  our presence here today despite the on  going covid 19 pandemic demonstrates how crucial climate change is on our agenda the lives that will be lost due to the adverse effects of climate change if we do not act now will be much worse than the pandemic needless to say our issues have been further compounded with the devastation of the covid  19 pandemic like other small island developing states  the republic of seychelles recognises that building resilience to climate change and committing to a low  emission development pathway provide a firm basis for continued growth and sustainable development we view climate change as an increasingly dire emergency that challeng es all aspects of our chances for future survival and o fully achieve the sustainable development goals nonetheless seychelles stands steadfast alongside our fellow sids in remaining politically morally and socially committed  meaningful p rogress on climate action is urgently required as highlighted by the ipcc and wmo recently to put us on a path to a 15°c future  as small as our contributions are to the degradation of the planet we are committed to further reducing them through our updated na tionally determined contribution or ndc because we feel it and we know it our issues have been further compounded by the devastation of the covid  19 pandemic 2 mr president the world must build a vision for a climate resili ent future that puts adaptation and loss and damage at the centre of decision  making and take immediate action now to protect people the economy and the environment seychelles acknowledge s that adaptation challenges require inclusive and sensitive glob al action and we share a collective ambition in line with the sdgs to achieve a global society in which no person  no country is left behind it is imperative that we step up our efforts to meet these urgent challenges mr president seychelles therefore call s on industrialized countries to take the lead in step ping up and display ing the leadership they claim to stake to the level that the science tells us is required to keep 15 alive clinging to coal and failing to help us all accelerate the clean energy transition while parading as climate champions is nothing but bad faith we have in this cop the daunting task of concluding the paris rulebook before we leave glasgow countries need to rediscover the political courage they had in paris in 2015 to complete the rulebook on time we must build the vessels we need to carry us towards a low carbon and clean energy future i t is now up to us leaders to fill these vessels with increased ambition on climate action to close the substantial gap between the commitment s countries have put forward to reduce their emissions and the much higher level of ambition needed to meet the temperature limitation goals established in the paris agreement w e must pick up the pace of the negotia tions significantly if the paris agreement implementation rules are to be finalis ed at this cop  mr president substantial progress also has to be made on the critical issue of ramping up financial and capacity  building support to sids like seychelles and other developing countries to accelerate the deployment of clean energy  nature  based and other climate solutions and to better meet the worse ning impacts of climate change this must be a much higher priority going forward because the usd 100 billion per year in climate financing by 2020 as pledged is long overdue 3 mr president the science clearly indicates that now is the time for all leaders to walk the talk and immediately start implementing the paris agreement roadmap the 2030 climate and energy package ndc is  for an example  an opportunity for us to show leadership in adopting more ambitious targets for renewables and energy efficiency in coherence with the paris agreement  it is an opportunity to prove that sids are

focused on three areas over dependence on imports lack of diversification and heavy debt burdens  these development challenges add to our structural vulnerabilities deriving from the smallnes s of our markets the exposure to climate related s hocks and remoteness which together lead to lower long  term development potential and increased losses in the face of adversity most sids members are not eligible for concessional financing because they are classified as middle  or high  income countries the covid  19 pandemic has exacerbated these structural vulnerabilities and compounded risks consequently the call for and endorsement of a multi  dimensional vulnerability index mvi will allow for t he inclusion of more than just income  based criteria t o assess eligibility for co

the 15 degrees celsius goal th e global goal on adaptation has failed to achieve a commensurate level of attention and action at cop26 we must ensure that we have an outcome that helps to raise adaptation ambition and action  establishing a specific work 3 programme after cop26 to de fine the details for the global goal on adaptation will be key trinidad and tobago is a small island developing state already experiencing the effects of climate change loss and damage are already clear in the aggressive erosion of our coastline and the bleaching of our coral reefs tackling loss and damage must remain a critical and core issue of any global climate action framework we are increasingly concerned about our ability to address this issue given the well  known difficulty in accessing f inancing for such projects we need funds like the green climate fund to establish specific streams for loss and damage finance to ensure that this is prioritized in the same way as mitigation and adaptation further there must be equitable ba lance between public finance for mitigation and adaptation 4 cop26 will be a critical point at which we can assess whether our climate finance flows are headed in the right direction in this regard the us announcement that it would double its climate finance support is particularly inspiring this is the type of bold action all donor countries need to consider in the weeks ahead the mobilization of private finance will also be critical for securing the urgently needed investment particularly for the transformation of our energy sectors mr president we must complete the work to implement the enhanced transparency framework even as a small country with limited resources we will make every effort to report to the required standard with some as sistance of course we expect others to do the same this is the deal we made in paris we cannot go back on it now 5 mr president as an economy largely based on oil and gas and petrochemicals we in trinidad and tobago recognize our responsibility i n transitioning over reasonable and manageable time to net zero we have set very ambitious targets aimed at diversifying our economy we have embarked upon ambitious plans to reduce emissions and build climate resilience but we will need help these m easures include the following we are in the process of establishing the largest utility  scale solar renewable energy project in the caribbean with a capacity of 112 megawatts accounting for 10 of our power needs and we plan to increase this complement to 30 by 2030 we have developed an e  mobility policy and we are already implementing measures to phase  in electric vehicles 6 we recognize the need to address the socio  economic issues associated with the energy t ransition and have developed a just transition of the workforce policy aimed at reskilling retooling and developing new capacity for a low  carbon economy we are pursuing measures to facilitate investment in green hydrogen to provide green feedst ock to our vibrant petrochemical industry we intend to explore the use of industry  generated co in possible carbon sequestration projects mr president cop26 has created great expectations and heightened hopes for climate ambition for trinid ad and tobago this ambition includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing much needed climate finance to enable vulnerable 7 countries to adapt to climate impacts and assist in transforming their economies to more sustainable low  carbon paths beyond the rhetoric and pledges every country needs to be serious about urgent action in this decade trinidad and tobago is committed to working with all countries in the multilateral framework to ensure a safe and secure world for those yet to be born it is my sincere hope that we will all be able to look back at cop 26 and the commitments and progress made here in glasgow as key steps towards a healthier salvageable planet earth choose extinction mr president i thank you ', 'tuvalu national statement for the world leaders summit honourable prime minister kausea natano mr president heads of government leaders excellencies ladies and gentlemen i first wish to express my profound gratitude to the government and people of the united kingdom for the kind hospitality accorded to my delegation we are gathered here at the beginning of negotiations for cop26 a cop marked not only by clear evidence of the increasingly dire impacts of climate change and sea level rise b ut also by a far  flung pandemic that has again and again demonstrated the interconnected nature of our global community what we do at home reverberates around the world reminding us of our collective responsibility to address climate change for the well  being of humanity this cop must be a cop of action we must act now to ensure that all states recognize their shared responsibility to protect the global community and to ensure that all states are held accountable for this responsibility we must lead th e charge to develop global norms practices and meaningful changes to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change and sea level rise tuvalu wishes to reaffirm the critical urgency of the climate change crisis facing pacific sids despite our negl igible contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions we urge world leaders to similarly affirm the critical urgency of this crisis rising sea levels extreme weather events declining marine resources rising food insecurity these are the alarming and detrimental consequences of climate change the single greatest threat to our pacific livelihoods security and welfare mr president despite the call made by pacific islands forum leaders in 2019 through the kainaki ii declaration for urgent climate ac tion now to limit global warming to 15°c above pre  industrial levels i want to make it plainly clear that even if all ghg emissions ceased tomorrow tuvalu and other low  lying atoll nations are sinking and our land is fast disappearing under all cur rent emissions scenarios considered global surface temperatures will continue to increase until at least the mid  century global warming of 15°c and 2°c will be exceeded during the 21 st century unless deep reductions in emissions occur today right now 40 of the central not predicted future measures this is the reality we are living with today we cannot wait we must make bold decisions and take firm action to secure our future mr president we must conclude negotiations on the paris rulebook and safeguard the integrity of the paris agreement by stopping measures that will stall progress on its objectives we therefore urge global major emitters t o commit to stronger climate action and to formulate mid  century long  term low emissions development strategies the success of this cop depends entirely on the commitment of you the global major emitters and your readiness to help the least developed c ountries and small island developing states are looking to you for you have the means to help and the moral responsibility to do so furthermore you have the technology and the resources to save us mr president i travelled thousands of miles and thr ough many transit points over 4 days to be here because i trust and have faith in international cooperation and multilateralism for losing faith and trust is to accept the total demise of my country to sea level rise my country has an average land elevation of 19 meters above sea level the science is predicting our total submersion due to sea level rise within this century this is a fate not unique to tuvalu but similar to that predicted for other atoll nations and low  lying coastal areas supporting millions of lives and livelihoods mr president i have faith in our collective humanity and our ability to achieve global solidarity to undertake urgent climate change action now so that my country tuvalu can have t ime to adapt and save ourselves i am not asking for anything new what i am asking for is what the paris agreement is demanding from the international community and particularly from those of us who have the capacity and the resources to contribute to g lobal efforts to curb climate change mr president global solidarity is central to addressing the climate crisis for the climate crisis is a global problem climate change is the greatest challenge of our time it is wreaking havoc everywhere places tha t were once considered safe are no longer so but climate impacts are only increasing in frequency and severity are we content to create for our children and their children a future of constant fear and uncertainty a future replete with conflict as clima te impacts exacerbate social tensions none of us as responsible leaders would want that for our youth and our future generations mr president let us bring ourselves closer to the problem as a global family it is time that we own the problem so to gether let us take a human right  centered approach to the climate crisis let us focus on saving lives and livelihoods while we still have the slightest bit of time on our side we can always recover from financial crises including those caused by pandem ics and we have demonstrated that but these are nothing compared to the economic costs we face when the social fabric of societies is torn asunder as lands become uninhabitable resulting in uncontrolled migration and widespread forced climate displacemen t in tuvalu we are already living the future impacts of climate change now consequently soft adaptation approaches such as nature  based solutions help but at 19 meters above sea level they will not save tuvalu from sea level rise tuvalu urgently needs adaptation measures based on building physical infrastructure to save ourselves we are investing in building raised reclamation lands to preserve our physical existence as a viable state this is our utmost priority now there is no point in invest ing in soft and piecemeal adaptation measures when we are losing our land territory at an alarming rate easy a ccess to adequate and predictable climate finance is critical and we urge developed economies to raise their commitments under the paris agreeme nt to mobilize us100 billion for climate finance and constructively discuss a new finance goal for post 2025 that takes its floor at us100 billion and that is based on science beyond this we must also strive to bring climate finance into the developmen t paradigm we must recognize that the finance needs of developing countries are much higher than what is being provided and mobilized and ensure that climate finance is clearly defined to guarantee that it is effective and meets the needs of all ldcs and pacific sids tuvalu appreciates the funding assistance it has received to mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis and sincerely hopes to strengthen genuine and durable partnerships with our development partners however we must dismantle our current t hinking about climate finance and rebuild our approach adaptation must be country led efficient and unencumbered we can no longer adhere to strict rules and controls that leave climate finance beyond our reach and that stop us from pursuing bold long  term adaptation priorities targeted and appropriate capacity building and enhanced access to and transfer of the most viable and applicable technology is also critical for sids and more attention must be paid to the technology and capacity needs of these countries too often medium and long  term adaptation finance and implementation have been left to the private sector to handle private sector support is critical and should be enhanced but it should not overshadow the important resources that can be of fered through international public finance we must mobilize large  scale adaptation financing now financing that is not delayed by covid  19 that prioritizes the most vulnerable and that is sourced through the markets mechanism and delivered through publi c and grant  based financing rather than loans our success as pacific sids depends on this we must cooperate to conclude article 6 negotiations and finalize an article 6 that delivers substantial overall mitigation in global emissions as well as substan tial financial resources to assist vulnerable developing countries in meeting the costs of adaptation mr president however we adapt to cope with the increasing devastation of climate change and sea level rise for some of us the capacity to adapt is waning for technical and financial reasons consequently we will bear the burden of significant costs due to loss and damage even at safer temperature levels therefore we call on all parties to cooperate and conclude the warsaw international mechanism and the work of the santiago network we cannot allow the reallocation of adaptation funding to address loss and damage we require stronger guidance on loss and damage financing and we must develop new financing mechanisms or funding windows for loss and damage this would include consideration of the impacts of climate change on fisheries as part of loss and damage under slow onset events mr president the existential threat of climate change and sea level rise has strengthened our resolve to preserve our statehood and sovereignty in this respect we have embarked on international discussion on legal mechanisms that can recognize our maritime boundaries and assets as permanent despite the impacts of sea level rise we must also ensure that legal mechan isms are in place to protect the cultures languages and heritages of nations like tuvalu including through digitization and building mobile digital nations we must uphold domestic regional and international endeavors to this effect such as the decl aration on preserving maritime zones in the face of climate change  related sea  level rise  this regional declaration was endorsed by pacific islands forum leaders this year and seeks to ced as a result of climate change  related sea  level rise in the midst of cop26 we signed an agreement with the prime minister of antigua and barbuda to establish a commission of small island states on climate change and international law the commission is authorized to request advisory opinions from the international tribunal for the law of the sea itlos on the legal responsibility of states for carbon emissions marine pollution and rising sea levels we must support initiatives of this nature to de velop and implement fair and just global and environmental norms and practices  including compensation for loss and damage  mr president the impacts of climate change are affecting the entire world including the republic of china taiwan and taiwan con tinues to effectively contribute to global efforts in combating the impacts of climate change through renewable energy innovations national policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and providing support for countries like tuvalu that are at the forefr ont of climate change to truly and fully address the impacts of climate change we must welcome the meaningful participation of taiwan in the activities of the unfccc for atoll nations the ravages of sea level rise will defeat all of our efforts and dev elopment gains with regard to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the 17 sustainable development goals current global mitigation commitments and promises will not save us for atoll nations like tuvalu we urgently require the means to build r aised reclamation land to save ourselves all other adaptation measures are secondary and should come only after we have secured the continued physical existence of our land territory despite the effects of sea level rise before i leave cop26 i was hono red to be given this scarf just yesterday a gift from the aboriginal people of australia it displays the colors of global warming with the strong message thank you fakafetai lasi and may god bless us all ', '', ' 1 cop26 national statement your excellencies your highnesses ladies and gentlemen it is an honor to represent my country here at the 26th session of the conference of the underlining the urgent need to accelerate climate sustainable future i thank the uk presidency for hosting and chairing this and for its efforts to strengthen our collective ambition for climate action let me first convey to you the warmest greetings from the leadership government and people of the united arab emirates  we approach this conference in a spirit of cooperation dialogue and partnership  in the same way that we have welcomed the world to expo 20 20 dubai where minds and creating the future honorable guests sustainable growth has long been an essential part of the set out the principles of sustainability in all sectors these principles have been integral to diversifying energy sources and developing po licies to reduce the impact of climate change the effects of climate change are relevant to all small or large developed or today there is an even more urgent need to redouble efforts and strengthen action to reduce emissions and adapt to the impact of climate change  t hrough a realistic inclusive and integrated approach that focuses on practical and commercially viable solutions as well as the application of cutting  edge technology and innovation the uae sees an opportunity for economic growth with positive social impacts through this approach to climate action we must hold back emissions not growth and progress 2 ladies and gentlemen we have entered a new era of transition in the energy sector the uae views this as an opportunity to focus on new paths towards the we believe that investing in low  carbon solutions in the energy sector will drive economic prosperity last month  the uae launched the net zero by 2050 strategic this is in line with the vision of the uae leadership and reflects the ambitions we have outlined years of our nation it was developed through a resilient integrated approach focusing on the need for and ensuring the participation of all stakeholders to create an ambitious yet practical agenda it is also an open invitation to find sustainable creating incentives for economic growth  the uae believes that this growth must be climate solutions should be flexible taking in to consideration the different needs of all we should avoid a one  size  fits  all approach it has been many years since developed countries pledged 100 billion to support climate action in developing countries fulfilling this pledge will reduce the impacts of climate change and help developing nations adapt to it in addition there is a strong need to creat e an investment ecosystem to support sustainable growth the uae has been a pioneer in supporting developing countries to adopt renewable energy we have for example committed more than one billion dollars in development aid for clean energy pr ojects in more than 70 countries alongside irena headquarter ed in uae we have announced 400 million dollars in new funding for the energy to boost investment and solutions in renewables further alongside the united states and over 30 other countries we have launched the agriculture innovation mission for climate to accelerate innovation for agri  tech  3 t he uae has pledged when it joins the un security council for 2022  23  to make climate action a priority  the uae has an impressive record in climate action which helps establish an efficient ecosystem that comprise s all the elements necessary to scale innovation in this area including capital research and development techn ology and project implementation and operation the uae has invested over 17 billion in clean energy projects in six continents around the world pause for close honored excellencies and h ighnesses ladies and gentlemen a s our nation celebrates its gol den jubilee this year  it also celebrates 50 years of sustainable growth the united arab emirates is proud to have been endorsed as the hosts of cop28 in 2023 by the asia pacific group of nations for this i would like to thank all our friends and partners we look forward to upcoming sessions and discussions in the next few days anticipating your support  i f the uae is confirmed as the host of cop28 by the united nations framework convention on climate change the uae is h onored to welcom e all parties in 2023 to work on developing practical solutions and make crucial progress on climate action thank you ', 'good afternoon everybody welcome to cop welcome to glasgow and to scotland whose most globally famous fictional son is almost certainly a man called james bond who generally comes to the climax of his highly lucrative films strapped to a doomsday device desperately trying to work out which coloured wire to pull to turn it off while a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human l ife as we know it and we are in roughly the same position my fellow global leaders as james bond today except that the tragedy is that this is not a movie and the doomsday device is real and the clock is ticking to the furious rhythm of hundreds of bill ions of pistons and turbines and furnaces and engines with which we are pumping carbon into the air faster and faster  record outputs and quilting the earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of co2 raising the temperature of the planet with a speed a nd an abruptness that is entirely manmade and we know what the scientists tell us and we have learned not to ignore them 2 degrees more and we jeopardise the food supply for hundreds of millions of people as crops wither locusts swarm 3 degrees and you ca n add more wildfires and cyclones twice as many of them five times as many droughts and 36 times as many heatwaves 4 degrees and we say goodbye to whole cities miami alexandria shanghai all lost beneath the waves and the longer we fail to act the worse it gets and the higher the price when we are eventually forced by catastrophe to act because humanity has long since run down the clock on climate change act now ous about climate change today it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow i was there with many of you in copenhagen 11 years ago when we acknowledged we had a problem i was there in paris six years ago when we agreed to net zero and to try t o restrain the rise in the temperature of the planet to 15c and all those promises will be nothing but blah blah blah  to coin a phrase and the anger and impatience of the world will be uncontainable unless we make this cop 26 in glasgow the moment when we get real about climate change and we can we can get real on coal cars cash and trees we have the technology to deactivate that ticking doomsday device not all at once i am afraid it is too late for that but one by one and with ever greater speed and efficiency we can begin to close down those billions of hydrocarbon combustion chambers that you find currently in every corner of the planet we can phase out the use of cars with hydrocarbon internal combustion engines by 2035 we can do that and w e in the uk are ending new sales by 2030 we can end the use of coal fired power stations we can do it by 2040 in the developing world and 2030 in the richer nations we can plant hundreds of millions of trees a trillion technologically difficu lt and halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 not just because it is a spiritually uplifting and beautiful thing to do but because that is the way to restore the balance of nature and to fix carbon in the air and as we look at the green industrial revoluti on that is now needed around the world we in the developed world must recognise the special responsibility to help everybody else to do it because it was here in glasgow 250 years ago that james watt came up with a machine that was powered by steam that was produced by burning coal and yes my friends we have brought you to the very place where the doomsday device began to tick and even though for 200 years the industrialised countries were in complete ignorance of the problem that they were creatin g we now have a duty now to find those funds deliver until 2023  to help the rest of the world to move to green technology but we cannot and will not succeed by government spending alo ne we in this room could deploy hundreds of billions no question but the market has hundreds of trillions and the task now is to work together to help our friends to decarbonise using our funds the funds we have in development assistance and working wit h the multilateral development banks so that in the key countries that need to make progress we can jointly identify the projects that we can help to de  risk so that the private sector can come in in just the same way that it was the private sector that enabled the uk to end our dependence on coal become the saudi arabia of wind we have the technology we can find the finance and we must and the question for all of us today is whether we have the will my fellow leaders i do not wish to put too fine a point on it but when we all talk about what we are going to do in 2050 or 2060 outside and the billions who are watching around the world half of the population of the world under 30 t hat the average age of this conclave of cardinals is 60 and i fully intend to be alive in 2060 i will be a mere 94 years old you never know but the people who will judge us are children not yet born and their child ren and we are now coming centre stage before a vast and uncountable audience of posterity and we must not fluff our lines or miss our cue because if we fail they will not forgive us they will know that glasgow was the historic turning point when history f ailed to turn they will judge us with bitterness and with a resentment that eclipses any of the climate activists of today and they will be right cop26 will not cannot be the end of the story on climate change even if this conference ends with binding global commitments for game  changing real world action two weeks from now smokestacks will still belch in industrial heartlands cows will still belch in their pastures  even if some brilliant kiwi scientists are teaching them to be more polite  cars p owered by petrol and diesel will still choke congested roads in and no one conference could ever change that if summits alone solved climate change then we would not have needed 25 previous cop summits to get to where we are today but while cop26 will not be the end of climate change it can and it must mark the beginning of the end in the years since paris the world has slowly and with great effort and pain built a lifeboat for humanity now is the time to give it a mighty shove into the water like some great liner rolling down the slipways of the clyde take a sextant sighting on 15c and set off on a journey to a cleaner greener future so let us therefore in the next days devote ourselves to this extraordinary task so that we not only continue with a programme a green industrial revolution that is already creating millions of high wage high skill jobs in power and technology taking our econo mies forward let us do enough to save our planet and our way of life and as we work let us think about those billions of beady eyes that are watching us around the world increasingly edgy and disenchanted and let us think of the billions more of the unborn whose anger will be all the greater if we fail we cannot let them down we have the ideas we have the technology we have the bankers we have the corporations and the ngos we have the interpreters and the meeting rooms and if all else fails we have the unb eatable hospitality and refreshment of glasgow we may not feel much like james bond not all of us necessarily look like james bond but we have the opportunity the duty to make this summit the moment when humanity finally began and i stress began to def use that bomb and make this the moment when we began irrefutably to turn the tide and to begin the fightback against climate change but yes we can do it goodwill that we possess thank you very much and good luck to all of us thank you ', ' 1 the secretary  general  remarks to the world leaders summit cop 26 glasgow 1 november 2021 2 prime minister johnson  i want to thank you and cop president alok sharma for your hospitality  leadership and tireless efforts in the preparation of this cop excellencies the six years since the paris climate agreement have been the six hottest years on record our addiction to fossil fuels is push ing humanity to the brink we face a stark choice e ither we stop it or it stops us 3 enough of brutalizing biodiversity enough of killing ourselves with carbon  enough of treating nature like a toilet enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper we are digging our own graves 4 our planet is changing b efore our eyes f rom the ocean depths to mountain tops from melting glaciers to relentless extreme weather events  sea  level rise is double the rate it was 30 years ago oceans are hotter than ever and getting warmer faster parts of the amazon rainforest now emit more carbon than they absorb 5 recent climate action a nnouncements might give the impression that we are on track to turn things around  this is an illusion the last published report on nationally determined contributions showed that they would still condemn the world to a calamitous 27 degree increase and even if the recent pledges were clear and credible and there are serious questions about some of them we are still careening towards climate catastrophe 6 even in the best  case scenario temperatures will rise well above two degrees so a s we open this much anticipated climate conference  we are still heading for climate disaster young people know it every country see s it small i sland d eveloping s tates and other vulnerable ones live it  for them failure is not an option 7 failure is a death sentence excellencies w e face a moment of truth we are fast approaching tipping points that will trigger escalating feedback loops of global heating but investing in the net zero climate resilient economy will create feedback loops of it s own virtuous circles of sustainable growth  jobs and opportunity 8 we have progress to build upon a number of countries have made credible commit ments to net  zero emissions by mid  century  many have pulled the plug on international financing of coal over 700 cities are leading the way to carbo n neutrality  the private sector is waking up 9 the net  zero asset owners alliance the gold standard for credible commitments and transparent targets is managing 10 trillion in assets and catalyzing change across industries  the climate action army led by young people is unstoppable they are larger they are louder and i assure you they are not going away i stand with them 10 excellencies the science is clear we know what to do first  we must keep the goal of 15 degree s celsius alive  this requires greater ambition on mitigation and immediate concrete action to reduce global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 g20 countries have a particular responsibility as they represent around 80 per cent of emissions 11 according to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in light of national circumstances  developed countries must lead the effort but emerging economies  too  must go the extra mile  as their contribution is essential for the effective reduction of emissions  we need maximum ambition from all countries on all fronts to make glasgow a success 12 i urge developed countries and emerging economies to build coalitions to create the financial and technological conditions to accelerate the decarbonization of the economy as well as the phase out of coal these coalitions are meant to support the large emitters that face more difficulties in the transition from grey to green illusions  if commitments fall short by the end of this cop  countries must revisit their national climate plans and policies 13 not every five years  every year until keeping to 15 degrees is assured  until subsidies to fossil fuels end  until there is a price on carbon and until coal is phased out  but we also need greater clarity 14 there is a deficit of credibility and a surplus of confusion over emissions reductions and net zero targets  with different meanings and different metrics that is why beyond the mechanisms already established in the paris agreement i am announcing today that i will establish a g roup of e xperts to propose clear standards to measure and analyze net zero commitments from non  state acto r s  15 second we must do more to protect vulnerable communities from the clear and present dangers of climate change over the last decade nearly 4 billion people suffered climate  related disasters that devastation will only grow adaptation works early warnin g systems save lives c limate  smart agriculture and infrastructure save jobs  16 all donors must allocate half their climate finance to adaptation public and multilateral development banks should start as soon as possible  third this cop must be a moment of solidarity t he 100 billion a year climate finance commitment in support of developing countries must become a 1 00 billion climate finance reality  this is critical to restoring trus t and credibility 17 i welcome efforts led by canada and germ any to help get us there  it is a first step but it delays the largest support for years  with no clear guarantees but beyond the  100 billion d eveloping c ountries need far greater resources to fight c ovid  19  build resilience and pursue sustainable development th os e suffering the most namely

level s egment of the 26 th conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change 10 november 2021 glasgow united kingdom cop26 president  distinguished excellencies high level dignitaries delegates  ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to join th is high level segment of the 26 th meeting of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework on climate change unfccc on behalf of the people of the republic of vanuatu whom i have the privilege of representing at this c op may i thank the government of the united kingdom through the leadership of the cop presiden cy for hosting cop26 meeting in glasgow this year despite the covid pandemic restrictions experienced today mr president i stand before you today concerned to my core about the onslaught of this climate emergency  a crisis that is devastating the nation of vanuatu  taking with it our livelihoods our natural resources territorial integrity our cultural identities our human rights and even our lives the recent ipcc special report has highlighted that the world is moving towards a rise in temperature of 3 degree celsius and that vanuatu as a small island developing states will continue t o face natural disasters sea  level rise droughts and ocean acidification therefore  as a small island nation c limate change remains the greatest threat to achieving our sustainable development goals even though we are not a major contributor of green house gases we are committed to working with the international community to redouble our efforts to reduce the rise in global temperatures so that by 2030 100 per cent of our electricity will be generated by renewable and sustainable energy this eff ort is part of our nationally determined contributions implementation mechanisms of the agreement needs to also trigger drastic and serious actions such as setting a moratorium on new coal mines and new fossil fuel extraction mr president vanuatu urge s parties to have new and updated ndcs that represent the highest possible ambition we would like to see the highest levels of pressure applied to parties who have not yet brought their ndcs in  line with 15  degree pathways we urge parties to reach a con sensus in the discussions for common time frames of the ndc article 6 of the paris agreement pa is an item of great importance and my country would like to see significant progress on the finalization and the operationalization of this article increasing ambition on article 6 will support the implementation and achievement of targets specified in n dcs the pa ambitions despite having ambitious 2030 targets this is achievable only through technical and financial support vanuatu however rom the paris agreement mandate on article 6 matters therefore i expect you to push for rapid decarbonization by 2030 starting with the eradication of fossil fuel subsidizes and agreement on no new coal oil or gas projects  in alignment with low emiss ion development strategies and net zero emissions by 2050  mitigation and addressing loss and damage is insufficient  i expect that you will hold parties responsible for meeting the 100 billion usd per year commitment they made in 2009 and reaffirmed in the paris agreement in 2015 b eyond 2026 that baseline amount must expand considerably to meet costs that will be in the trillions loss and damage is here and now and the unfccc mechanisms are not delivering  i want you to push for a fully operational santiago network on loss and damage one that serves as a technical and financial arm for us when we need it most the unfccc trans parency framework must be strengthened i would like you to call for comprehensive common tabular formats and reference tables particularly so we know that no double counting of emissions occurs and that the amount of climate finance mobilized and delive red is unambiguous adaptation is the top climate priority for vanuatu  i request for m ore support to mainstream integrate and implement national adaptation planning processes and start a robust process that will capture on in the global stocktake and as part of a new global adaptation goal vanuatu request for stronger language on the finance function of the santiago network we prefer language that requests potential snld hosts to make submissions early next year so we c an actually start responding to requests of the most vulnerable as soon as possible mr president my country strongly believes that science must be the ultimate basis for our work and welcomes the findings of the ipcc special reports specifically the special report on 15 degrees and the ipcc working group 1 sixth assessment report s cience confirms record rates of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and a terrifying approach towards the 15 °c global heating limit every year and every degree brings the pacific islands new levels of climate extremes and climate suffering we need to heed the science human  sustainable development and global efforts to protect planetary biodiversity and the future of our oceans our government is prioritizing legal pathways to hold polluters to account whether state parties or corporations whether far away or in the pacific region these grave climate injustices must stop by sustain ed radical and socially just cuts to emissions now not later for 29 years vanuatu has participated in the multilateral climate negotiations with good faith ambition and hope that nations would be able to work together to address the single greatest threat to the livelihood security and well  being of all people on this plant although our delegates d o not physically attending cop this year as our health experts have decided that it is in the best interest of our nation to stay covid free   but even from home we have delegates who are virtually engaging in the multilateral climate processes with the highest ambition therefore i call upon all negotiators to prioritize action
