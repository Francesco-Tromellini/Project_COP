# Project_COP
Topic Modeling appied to COP's speeches
## Presentation of the project
One of the most discussed public issues in recent years is undoubtedly climate change. This is a problem
that we all have in common, but, at the same time, divides nationals and internationals communities on
what is the right approach to have and what are the solutions with which we can try to fight it. Therefore it
becomes difficult, in the enormous amount of information on the topic, to summarize and find the focal
points around which this large public debate gravitates. This work aims to find the main arguments around
which the political discourse on climate change revolves, trying to understand which are the distinct topics
touched by the representatives of the nations at COP26 in Glasgow. The main tool used for this analysis
is Topic Modeling and, more specifically, the Latent Dirchlet Allocation technique.
